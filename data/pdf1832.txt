Overview

We often make simplifying modeling assumptions when analyzing a data set such as assuming each observation

comes from one specific distribution (say, a Gaussian distribution). Then we proceed to estimate parameters of

this distribution, like the mean and variance, using maximum likelihood estimation.

However, in many cases, assuming each sample comes from the same unimodal distribution is too restrictive and

may not make intuitive sense. Often the data we are trying to model are more complex. For example, they might

be multimodal – containing multiple regions with high probability mass. In this note, we describe mixture

models which provide a principled approach to modeling such complex data.

Example 1

Suppose we are interested in simulating the price of a randomly chosen book. Since paperback books are typically

cheaper than hardbacks, it might make sense to model the price of paperback books separately from hardback

books. In this example, we will model the price of a book as a mixture model. We will have two mixture

components in our model – one for paperback books, and one for hardbacks.

Let’s say that if we choose a book at random, there is a 50% chance of choosing a paperback and 50% of choosing

hardback. These proportions are called mixture proportions. Assume the price of a paperback book is

normally distributed with mean $9 and standard deviation $1 and the price of a hardback is normally distributed

with a mean $20 and a standard deviation of $2. We could simulate book prices Pi in the following way:

1. Sample Zi � Bernoulli(0.5)

2. If Zi = 0 draw Pi from the paperback distribution N(9, 1). If Zi = 1, draw Pi from the hardback distribution

N(20, 2).

We implement this simulation in the code below:

We see that our histogram is bimodal. Indeed, even though the mixture components are each normal

distributions, the distribution of a randomly chosen book is not. We illustrate the true densities below:

We see that the resulting probability density for all books is bimodal, and is therefore not normally distributed. In

this example, we modeled the price of a book as a mixture of two components where each component was

modeled as a Gaussian distribution. This is called a Gaussian mixture model (GMM).

Example 2

Now assume our data are the heights of students at the University of Chicago. Assume the height of a randomly

chosen male is normally distributed with a mean equal to 5′9 and a standard deviation of 2.5 inches and the

height of a randomly chosen female is N(5′4, 2.5). However, instead of 50/50 mixture proportions, assume that

75% of the population is female, and 25% is male. We simulate heights in a similar fashion as above, with the

corresponding changes to the parameters:

NUM.SAMPLES &lt;- 5000

heights      &lt;- numeric(NUM.SAMPLES)

for(i in seq_len(NUM.SAMPLES)) {

  z.i &lt;- rbinom(1,1,0.75)

 if(z.i == 0) heights[i] &lt;- rnorm(1, mean = 69, sd = 2.5)

 else heights[i] &lt;- rnorm(1, mean = 64, sd = 2.5)

}

hist(heights)

Now we see that histogram is unimodal. Are heights normally distributed under this model? We plot the

corresponding densities below:






Past versions of unnamed-chunk-4-1.png

Here we see that the Gaussian mixture model is unimodal because there is so much overlap between the two

densities. In this example, you can see that the population density is not symmetric, and therefore not normally

distributed.

These two illustrative examples above give rise to the general notion of a mixture model which assumes each

observation is generated from one of K mixture components. We formalize this notion in the next section.

Before moving on, we make one small pedagogical note that sometimes confuses students new to mixture models.

You might recall that if X and Y are independent normal random variables, then Z = X + Y is also a normally

distributed random variable. From this, you might wonder why the mixture models above aren’t normal. The

reason is that X + Y is not a bivariate mixture of normals. It is a linear combination of normals. A random

variable sampled from a simple Gaussian mixture model can be thought of as a two stage process. First, we

randomly sample a component (e.g. male or female), then we sample our observation from the normal

distribution corresponding to that component. This is clearly different than sampling X and Y from different

normal distributions, then adding them together.

Definition

Assume we observe X1, …, Xn and that each Xi is sampled from one of K mixture components. In the second

example above, the mixture components were {male,female}. Associated with each random variable Xi is a label

Zi � {1, …, K} which indicates which component Xi came from. In our height example, Zi would be either 1 or 2

depending on whether Xi was a male or female height. Often times we don’t observe Zi (e.g. we might just obtain

a list of heights with no gender information), so the Zi’s are sometimes called latent variables.

From the law of total probability, we know that the marginal probability of Xi is:

P(Xi = x) = K∑k=1P(Xi = x |Zi = k)P(Zi = k)�πk = K∑k=1P(Xi = x |Zi = k)πk

Here, the πk are called mixture proportions or mixture weights and they represent the probability that Xi

belongs to the k-th mixture component. The mixture proportions are nonnegative and they sum to one,

∑Kk=1πk = 1. We call P(Xi|Zi = k) the mixture component, and it represents the distribution of Xi assuming

it came from component k. The mixture components in our examples above were normal distributions.

For discrete random variables these mixture components can be any probability mass function p(. � Zk) and for

continuous random variables they can be any probability density function f(. � Zk). The corresponding pmf and




pdf for the mixture model is therefore:

p(x) = K∑k=1πkp(x � Zk) fx(x) = K∑k=1πkfx�Zk(x � Zk)

If we observe independent samples X1, …, Xn from this mixture, with mixture proportion vector

π = (π1, π2, …, πK), then the likelihood function is: L(π) = n∏i=1P(Xi|π) = n∏i=1K∑k=1P(Xi|Zi = k)πk

Now assume we are in the Gaussian mixture model setting where the k-th component is N(μk, σk) and the

mixture proportions are πk. A natural next question to ask is how to estimate the parameters {μk, σk, πk} from

our observations X1, …, Xn. We illustrate one approach in the introduction to EM vignette.

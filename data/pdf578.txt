The Forward Algorithm

Initialization

Forward algorithm initialization equation

Initialization of Forward Algorithm

Recursion

Forward algorithm recursion equation


Recursion of Forward Algorithm 1

0.24 * 0.8 * 0.1 = 0.0192

0.12 * 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.0048

α = 0.0192 +0.0048 = 0.024

0.8 * 0.3 * 1 = 0.24

0.2 * 0.05 * 1 = 0.01

β = 0.24 +0.01 = 0.25

Recursion of Backward Algorithm 2


0.4 * 0.3 * 1 = 0.12

0.6 * 0.05 * 1 = 0.03

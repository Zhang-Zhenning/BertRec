Abstract

Suppose that univariate data are drawn from a mixture of two distributions that are equal up to a shift parameter.

Such a model is known to be nonidentifiable from a nonparametric viewpoint. However, if we assume that the

unknown mixed distribution is symmetric, we obtain the identifiability of this model, which is then defined by four

unknown parameters: the mixing proportion, two location parameters and the cumulative distribution function of

the symmetric mixed distribution. We propose estimators for these four parameters when no training data is

available. Our estimators are shown to be strongly consistent under mild regularity assumptions and their

convergence rates are studied. Their finite-sample properties are illustrated by a Monte Carlo study and our

method is applied to real data.

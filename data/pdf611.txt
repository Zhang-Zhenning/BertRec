Multi-Stage Document Ranking with BERT

Rodrigo Nogueira, Wei Yang, Kyunghyun Cho, Jimmy Lin

The advent of deep neural networks pre-trained via language modeling tasks has spurred a number of successful applications in natural

language processing. This work explores one such popular model, BERT, in the context of document ranking. We propose two variants, called

monoBERT and duoBERT, that formulate the ranking problem as pointwise and pairwise classification, respectively. These two models are

arranged in a multi-stage ranking architecture to form an end-to-end search system. One major advantage of this design is the ability to trade

off quality against latency by controlling the admission of candidates into each pipeline stage, and by doing so, we are able to find operating

points that offer a good balance between these two competing metrics. On two large-scale datasets, MS MARCO and TREC CAR,

experiments show that our model produces results that are either at or comparable to the state of the art. Ablation studies show the

contributions of each component and characterize the latency/quality tradeoff space.

tends to vanish when k is large

The product of derivatives can also explode

So if we want (3) not to vanish, our network needs to increase the likelihood that at least

some of these sub gradients will not vanish

The error gradients in an LSTM network


Preventing the error gradients from vanishing

Notice that the gradient contains the forget gate’s vector of activations, which allows the

network to better control the gradients values, at each time step, using suitable parameter

updates of the forget gate.

It is the presence of the forget gate’s vector of activations in the gradient term along with

additive structure which allows the LSTM to find such a parameter update at any time

step

Another important property to notice is that the cell state gradient is an additive function


In RNNs, the sum in (3) is made from expressions with a similar behaviour that are

likely to all be in [0,1] which causes vanishing gradients.

In LSTMs, however, the presence of the forget gate, along with the additive property of the

cell state gradients, enables the network to update the parameter in such a way that the

different sub gradients in (3) do not necessarily agree

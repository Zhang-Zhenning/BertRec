Abstract: Computer-supported learning environment (CSLE) Information Retrieval Game (IR Game) is described and evaluated. The

IR Game is based on the idea that test collections used in laboratory-based IR experiments could be used in instruction as a rapid

query analysis tool. The goal is to provide a realistic environment for demonstrating the performance of queries in different types

of search situations. The outline of the IR Game is introduced both at the technical and instructional levels. An evaluation

experiment is reported revealing that students found different characteristics of the IR Game both enhancing and inhibiting

learning. The perceived usefulness of features like query performance feedback, visualization of serch results, comparison of

queries, document browsing and help facilities are discussed. Several ideas for the elaboration of information retrieval learning

environments are put forward. These include design of search tasks, implementation of feedback, social negotiation and

articulation of student's working theories.

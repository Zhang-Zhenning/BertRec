ABSTRACT

Existing neural ranking models follow the text matching paradigm,

where document-to-query relevance is estimated through predict-

ing the matching score. Drawing from the rich literature of classical

generative retrieval models, we introduce and formalize the para-

digm of deep generative retrieval models defined via the cumulative

probabilities of generating query terms. This paradigm offers a

grounded probabilistic view on relevance estimation while still en-

abling the use of modern neural architectures. In contrast to the

matching paradigm, the probabilistic nature of generative rankers

readily offers a fine-grained measure of uncertainty. We adopt sev-

eral current neural generative models in our framework and intro-

duce a novel generative ranker (T-PGN), which combines the encod-

ing capacity of Transformers with the Pointer Generator Network

model. We conduct an extensive set of evaluation experiments on

passage retrieval, leveraging the MS MARCO Passage Re-ranking

and TREC Deep Learning 2019 Passage Re-ranking collections. Our

results show the significantly higher performance of the T-PGN

model when compared with other generative models. Lastly, we

demonstrate that exploiting the uncertainty information of deep

generative rankers opens new perspectives to query/collection un-

derstanding, and significantly improves the cut-off prediction task.

INTRODUCTION

Neural ranking models have yielded remarkable improvements to

information retrieval (IR) by estimating a highly non-linear function

of relevance of a query to a document. Arguably, all existing neural

ranking models [7, 11, 12, 14, 25, 28, 33, 50] follow the text matching

paradigm, where relevance is calculated as the predicted matching

score of each document to a given query. In this sense, these neural

ranking models appear to be the descendants of matching-based

(or similarity-based) models such as the vector space model [42],

where the model estimates the relevance score of a document 𝐷

to a query 𝑄 by the matching function 𝑓 (𝑄, 𝐷). We refer to these

models (whether neural or classical ones) as matching models.

A generative view on IR was first introduced by Ponte and Croft

[36], where – unlike in matching models – relevance is expressed

in terms of a conditional probability in a well-formed probabilis-

tic framework. In particular, the query likelihood language model

estimates relevance as the probability of the query being gener-

ated by a language model of the document, namely 𝑃(𝑄|Φ𝐷). This

regime provides a powerful probabilistic framework to IR, and has

been the base for numerous approaches (see Zhai [56] for further

details). Our paper provides a modern perspective on the funda-

mental principle of the generative paradigm for IR through the

recent advancements in deep generative models. We introduce and

provide the theoretical foundations of deep generative ranking mod-

els, comprehensively study the characteristics and performance

of the models’ various architectural choices for passage retrieval,

and show the immediate benefits of the probabilistic nature of this

paradigm in providing more-than-relevance information.

Let us first discuss the overall architectural differences/similarities

across various IR models, as highlighted in Figure 1. Representation-

based models first encode query and document into separate em-

beddings, and then use these embeddings to calculate query-to-

document relevance scores [18, 19, 44]. In query-document interac-

tion models, the query-term-to-document-term interactions (in the

form of similarities or attention networks) are used to create a final

feature vector, and hence estimate the relevance score [7, 11, 12,

14, 18, 20, 25, 28, 34, 50]. In this category of models, large-scale pre-

trained language models such as BERT [8] have shown significant

improvements in retrieval performance [27, 31].

Deep generative ranking models (Figure 1c) view relevance esti-

mation as the probability of generating the query, given the docu-

ment. Models follow the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) encoder-

decoder architecture [45]. The model first encodes the document,

and then uses the encoded embeddings to provide probability dis-

tributions over the space of possible queries at the output of the

decoder. This framework in addition to effective estimation of rel-

evance, provides a distinctive benefit in comparison with other

retrieval models: the probabilistic nature of generative models en-

ables the extraction of actionable information in addition to mere

relevance scores. This probabilistic information for example can

take the form of uncertainty estimates of the model. Such uncer-

tainty estimation is directly achieved from the output of the model

and does not need any model modification, nor does it impose any

extra computation. As we show in the present work, this uncertainty

information can effectively be exploited for better understanding of

the underlying collection and training data, and also in downstream

tasks such as rank cut-off prediction.

In addition, the decoupling of query/document encoding in the

architecture of deep generative model enables the ranking model

to store document embeddings at index time and later exploit them

at inference time (similar to representation-based models). At the

same time, the decoder embeddings still effectively interact with

encoded embeddings (typically through attention mechanisms),

which is analogous to interaction-focused models. The use of at-

tention mechanisms over the document during decoding facilitates

effective interaction with encoded document embeddings (as in

query-document interaction models), but also enables the poten-

tial incorporation of orthogonal notions, such as personalization,

diversity or fairness into the model.

The present work explores various aspects of the generative IR

paradigm from the perspective of deep generative models. Con-

cretely, we first formalize the theoretical connection between the

introduced deep generative ranking models and classical generative

IR models, in particular the query likelihood language model.

We then investigate the effectiveness of various generative archi-

tectures in passage retrieval. To this end, we conduct a comprehen-

sive study on the use of the state-of-the-art neural language gen-

eration techniques for retrieval. We study various models, among

them Pointer Generator Networks (PGN) [43], and a recently pro-

posed combination of BERT and Transformers [24]. In addition to

these models, we combine the benefits of T-PGN in query decoding

with those of BERT in document encoding, and propose a new

generative ranking model referred to as T-PGN. We evaluate these

generative models on the MS MARCO Passage Re-ranking [30]

and the TREC Deep Learning 2019 Passage Re-ranking task [6].

The results demonstrate that among the generative models, our

introduced T-PGN model shows the overall best performance.

Finally, drawing from the probabilistic framework of deep gen-

erative models, we calculate a measure of uncertainty reflecting

the model’s confidence in the prediction of a given query. The un-

certainty estimate is achieved by calculating the entropy values of

the probability distributions of query term generation. We use the

resulting uncertainty estimates to first analyze the existence of bias

with respect to term positions in the queries of MS MARCO and

then exploit this extra information for cut-off prediction, observing

a significant improvement in the task.

To summarize, our main contribution is four-fold:

• Introducing the novel deep generative ranking models and

formalizing them in the perspective of classical generative

IR models.

• Adopting several recent deep generative language models for

ranking, and introducing a new generative ranker (T-PGN).

• Conducting a large set of evaluation experiments on various

generative models for passage retrieval.

• Showcasing the potential of deep generative ranking models

for uncertainty estimation of relevance scores and its use in

a cut-off prediction task.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related

literature. In Section 3, we introduce the deep generative rank-

ing models and explain various architectural choices as well as

their potential for uncertainty estimation. Section 4 describes our

design of experiments, whose results are reported and discussed


in Section 5. The accompanying source code is available at https:

RELATED WORK

2.1

Neural Retrieval Models

In the category of query-document interaction models, we can dis-

tinguish between three groups of models. The first group captures

patterns of similarity values across terms that appear close together

within the query and within the document [11, 20, 21, 34]. The

second group captures patterns of frequencies across ranges of sim-

ilarity values [7, 12–14, 50]. The last ones are based on large-scale

pre-trained language models, as the use of these models has shown

significant performance gains in various IR tasks.

For instance, the BERT model is used for document/passage re-

trieval through fine-tuning [31], combining them with other rank-

ing models [27], expanding to other more efficient variations [26]

or dense retrieval approaches [22, 51]. In this paper, we also investi-

gate the benefits of exploiting such large-scale pre-trained language

models in the context of deep generative ranking models.

Finally, in addition to the mentioned neural models, other studies

exploit the inherent efficiency of classic IR models while aiming to

improve their effectiveness using pre-trained embedding models.

This is done for instance by generalizing term salience with transla-

tion models [38, 40], and re-weighting terms [57], or through adapt-

ing word embeddings for document retrieval by post-filtering [39],

retrofitting [16], or re-training on local documents [9].

2.2

Neural Generative Models in IR

Neural generative models have been utilized in various IR tasks.

As examples, Zamani et al. [54] study the use of a seq2seq model

to generate queries, whose results are used as a source of weak

supervision for asking clarifying questions. Ren et al. [41] and later

Yang et al. [53] approach the task of reformulating conversational

queries into search-engine-friendly queries using seq2seq with

attention models. Ahmad and Chang [1], Ahmad et al. [2] use

a similar generative model to train a query recommender, which

facilitates the reformulation of users’ queries and hence the effective

ranking of documents.

In the context of neural ranking models, Nogueira et al. [33]

use a seq2seq Transformer model [47, 55] to expand documents

with generated queries, and adopt a BERT-based matching model

to conduct retrieval on the expanded documents. In a more recent

work, Nogueira et al. [32] exploit the T5 model [37] (a pre-trained

Transformer-based seq2seq model) to perform binary classification

of query-document pairs as relevant or irrelevant. In this approach,

query and document are both given as the input to the encoder,

and the generated output of the decoder is two possible tokens

(“true” or “false”) corresponding to the relevant and non-relevant

class. The authors use the logits corresponding to the two tokens

to infer the relevance score. Based on the discussion in Section 1

and on Figure 1, despite the seq2seq architecture of this model, this

approach can in fact be categorized among the query-document

interaction models, since the input is the concatenation of query and

document, and the output is their relevance score. In contrast, the

deep generative models presented in the work at hand generate text

queries from input documents, where the probability of generating

each query term is defined over all possible words (and not over

two tokens). Parallel to our work, Zhuang et al. [58] investigate

query likelihood models built upon a Transformer-based seq2seq

architecture. Our work expands their study by investigating a wide

range of deep generative architectures in IR ranking, and showing

the fundamental benefits of generative ranking models for query

understanding and in downstream tasks.

In a larger context, neural language generation models span vari-

ous language processing tasks, i.e. machine translation [47], abstrac-

tive document summarization [24, 43], dialogue generation [48],

and question answering [10, 49]. The present work benefits from

and contributes to these studies by adopting deep generative mod-

els in the context of retrieval, and introducing a new generative

model.

DEEP GENERATIVE RANKING MODELS

In the following, we first formulate deep generative ranking models

by highlighting their connections to classical generative models [3,

36, 56]. We then describe the various loss functions used to train the

models, followed by a detailed description of the proposed T-PGN

and other generative ranking models used in this study. Finally, we

introduce our approach to uncertainty estimation defined on the

probability space resulting from deep generative rankers.

3.1

Definition

Ponte and Croft [36] introduced the language modeling approach to

IR and proposed a new scoring model based on this approach, which

later has been called the query likelihood model (QL). The language

modeling approach defines the relevance of document 𝐷 to query

𝑄 based on the conditional probability 𝑃(𝑄|𝐷).1 This probability is

rooted in the idea that a user who wants to find document 𝐷 would

utilize query 𝑄 to retrieve the document [56]. 𝑃(𝑄|𝐷) is defined

by 𝑃(𝑄|Φ𝐷) – the probability of generating query 𝑄 using the

language model Φ𝐷, built based on document 𝐷. Zhai [56] explains

the objective of Φ𝐷 as “modeling the queries that a user would use

in order to retrieve documents”, highlighting the fact that, although

Φ𝐷 is a document language model, it is effectively a model meant

for queries and not for documents.

The most well-known way to use the language modeling ap-

proach is by utilizing a multinomial language model assuming

query term independence [56], resulting in the following model

formulation, known as QL:

QL:

𝑃(𝑄|𝐷) ≈ 𝑃(𝑄|Φ𝐷) =

�

𝑞𝑖 ∈𝑄

𝑃(𝑞𝑖 |Φ𝐷)

(1)

The language model Φ𝐷 is commonly defined as a unigram proba-

bility distribution of 𝐷 over all terms in the vocabulary, smoothed

using the collection as background statistics. The relevance score

of query to document is defined as the logarithm of the conditional

probability.

QL:

score(𝑄, 𝐷) =

∑︁

𝑞𝑖 ∈𝑄

log 𝑃(𝑞𝑖 |Φ𝐷)

(2)

Deep generative ranking models follow a similar perspective to

relevance estimation as the QL: Document 𝐷 should be scored as

more relevant to query 𝑄 if the model assigns a higher value to the

probability of generating𝑄 when conditioned on 𝐷. This probability

1More precisely, 𝑃 (𝑄 |𝐷, 𝑅 = 𝑟), i.e. the probability of 𝑄 given 𝐷 and a level of

relevance 𝑟.


is calculated based on an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder

receives document 𝐷 as a sequence of input tokens and provides a

(contextualized) representation of the document. The decoder uses

the document’s representation as well as previous query tokens and

estimates as output the probability of generating the next query

token. The decoder is in fact a query language model which outputs

the probability of generating the next query token, conditioned on

the representation of the document in auto-regressive fashion (one

after another). Given such a generative model, the relevance score is

defined as the probability of generation of the query, conditioned on

the document. The generation probability is formulated as follows:

𝑃𝜃 (𝑄|𝐷) =

�

𝑞𝑖 ∈𝑄

𝑃𝜃 (𝑞𝑖 |𝐷,𝑞𝑗&lt;𝑖)

(3)

where 𝑞𝑗&lt;𝑖 denotes the query tokens preceding the current token,

and 𝜃 indicates the model’s parameters learned using training data.

Similar to QL, the relevance score is defined as the logarithm of the

conditional probability:

score(𝑄, 𝐷) =

∑︁

𝑞𝑖 ∈𝑄

log 𝑃𝜃 (𝑞𝑖 |𝐷,𝑞𝑗&lt;𝑖)

(4)

Having outlined the conceptual similarities of deep generative

ranking models and QL, let us now discuss the differences, par-

ticularly by comparing the formulations in Eq. 1 and Eq. 3. One

difference is that deep generative models are not constrained by the

term independence assumption, as the generation of each token is

conditioned on the previous terms. Another difference is rooted in

the language models that deep generative models use to generate

queries. While QL utilizes Φ𝐷 – the language model of document

𝐷 – deep generative models use the query language model that

is created by observing all queries in the training data. In fact, in

contrast to QL, deep generative ranking models explicitly train

a language model for queries, whose generation probabilities are

conditioned on the given document. In this sense, deep generative

ranking models can be seen as an alternative implementation of

the language modeling approach to IR, while still benefiting from

the advantages of neural ranking models.

3.2

Ranking Loss Functions

Considering the provided formulation of deep generative ranking

models, we discuss in this section the training loss functions used to

train generative models. Given a pairwise learning-to-rank setting,

the training data of retrieval models is provided in the form of a

query 𝑄 with a relevant and a non-relevant document, denoted as

𝐷+ and 𝐷− respectively.

The first loss is the well-known negative log likelihood (NLL),

commonly used to train generative models, and defined as follow:

LNLL = −

∑︁

(𝑄,𝐷+) ∈T

log 𝑃𝜃 (𝑄|𝐷+)

(5)

where T denotes the collection of training data. It is evident that

NLL only considers the relevant document and does not use the

non-relevant one. The next loss function is margin ranking (Marg)

formulated below:

LMarg =

∑︁

(𝑄,𝐷+,𝐷−) ∈T

max{0,𝑏 − log 𝑃𝜃 (𝑄|𝐷+) + log 𝑃𝜃 (𝑄|𝐷−)}

The Marg loss increase the differences between the predicted rele-

vance score of the relevant document and the predicted relevance

score of the non-relevant document up to a margin threshold 𝑏.

This loss can accept relevance scores in any range and is therefore

commonly adopted in ranking models.

Our final loss function proposed by dos Santos et al. [10] expands

NLL by adding the unlikelihood probability of negative documents,

namely the logarithm of one minus probability of the negative

document in training data. We refer to this loss as negative log

likelihood log unlikelihood (NL3U), defined as follows:

LNL3U = −

∑︁

(𝑄,𝐷+) ∈T

log 𝑃𝜃 (𝑄|𝐷+) + log(1 − 𝑃𝜃 (𝑄|𝐷−))

(7)

3.3

Neural Generative Ranking Architectures

Based on our formulation of neural generative ranking models,

any neural generative model can be exploited for retrieval, namely

by calculating the query-to-document relevance estimated from

the generation probability distributions. In the following, we first

briefly describe the generative models studied in this paper, and

then explain our proposed T-PGN model. These models are selected

based on their strong performance in tasks such as abstractive

document summarization and machine translation.

Seq2SeqAttention. The Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention

model [29] is an extension to the baseline Sequence-to-Sequence

model [45]. The baseline model consists of an encoder LSTM and a

decoder LSTM, where the last hidden state of the encoder is given

to the initial hidden state of the decoder. Seq2SeqAttention ex-

tends this models by the attention network, defined on the encoder

hidden states and conditioned on the hidden state of the decoder

LSTM. This attention mechanism enables the immediate access of

the decoder to all document embeddings at encoder, facilitating

information flow in the model.

erating the term Fuel is the same in both cases, the upper

distribution contains a much higher degree of uncertainty.

PGN. See et al. [43] introduce the Pointer Generator Network,

which expands the Seq2SeqAttention model by a novel copy mech-

anism. The objective of this copy mechanism is to facilitate the

transfer of the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms appearing in the doc-

ument directly to the output query. This approach has shown highly

competitive performance in abstractive summarization benchmarks.

This is due to the fact that in summarization (similar to IR) rare

words – which are commonly removed from the list of vocabularies

due to their low collection frequencies – can be highly salient, and

hence crucial for the success of the task.

Transf2Transf. The Transformer-to-Transformer is introduced

by Vaswani et al. [47] in the context of machine translation. The

model consists of multiple layers of encoder Transformers to con-

textualize document embeddings with self-attention, followed by

multiple layers of decoder Transformers. The decoder Transformers

generate output probability distributions by contextualizing query

embeddings and attending to the final embeddings of the encoder.

BERT2Transf. The BERT-to-Transformer model, recently intro-

duced by Liu and Lapata [24], achieves state-of-the-art results on

abstractive text summarization collections. The model has a similar

architecture to the one of Transf2Transf but instead of Transformers

uses a BERT model encoder.

Transformer Pointer Generator Networks (T-PGN). We in-

troduce the Transformer Pointer Generator Networks model (T-

PGN) which combines the advantages of the PGN model with Trans-

formers. The architecture of the model is shown in Figure 2. The

T-PGN model provides a multi-layer encoder Transformer to create

contextualized word embeddings of document terms. These em-

beddings are then passed to the encoder LSTM, whose final hidden

state is used as the initial state of the decoder LSTM. Similar to PGN,

the attention distribution over the contextualized document em-

beddings (containing the OOV terms) is combined with the output

distribution provided by the decoder to form the final distribution.

This provides a probability distribution of query generation de-

fined over all words in the vocabulary as well as the OOV terms

appearing in document.

3.4

Uncertainty Estimation in Neural

Generative Rankers

Given a document, deep generative models predict a probability

distribution for each term of a query. As discussed in Section 1, this

probabilistic perspective enables the calculation of the uncertainty

of the model with respect to this prediction. In the following, we

explain our approach to calculating an uncertainty estimate given

any deep generative model.

At every step 𝑖 of query term generation, the deep generative

models estimate a probability distribution over all terms of the

vocabulary. Despite the selected probability value for the term in

the position 𝑖, 𝑃𝜃 (𝑞𝑖 |𝐷,𝑞𝑗&lt;𝑖), the form of the predicted probability

distribution reveals parallel information about the model. In fact,

the same generation probability of a term may result from different

kinds of probability distributions. This point is illustrated with a toy

example in Figure 3 for the term Fuel. As shown, if the distribution

of the term generation probabilities is close to uniform (the upper

graphic in Figure 3), the model is not certain about the generation

probability, as many terms have comparable chance to be generated

in the next position. In contrast, when the distribution is more

skewed, the model is more certain about possible generation terms

(the lower graphic in Figure 3). Despite these different distributions,

the predicted probability values of Fuel in both distributions are

equal. In fact, this term-level uncertainty provides extra information

that might not be captured in the predicted probability values, and

hence the predicted relevance score.

Similar to Xu et al. [52], we define term-level uncertainty as the

entropy of the nucleus probability distribution at each step. The

nucleus distribution [17] provides a well-behaved version of the

original generation probability distribution, by redistributing the

very low probability values. More concretely, the nucleus distribu-

tion recomputes the probability distribution only on the 𝑘 most

probable terms, where 𝑘 is chosen such that the accumulated prob-

abilities of these 𝑘 terms is equal to or greater than a predefined

threshold 𝑝. Similar to Xu et al. [52], we set 𝑝 = 0.95.

Given the nucleus probability distribution for the generation of

the term at time step 𝑖, denoted as 𝑋𝑖, the term-level uncertainty

of the model is calculated as follows:

term-level uncertainty(𝑋𝑖) = −

∑︁

𝑥 ∈𝑋𝑖

𝑃(𝑥) · log 𝑃(𝑥)

(8)

Using this definition, we can estimate a model’s uncertainty

with respect to generating the whole query, namely query-level

uncertainty, by aggregating term-level uncertainty values. To this

end, various aggregation functions (such as mean, entropy, variance,

and maximum) can be applied to the corresponding values of each

query. We further investigate the characteristic of this uncertainty

estimation for model/collection analysis and the cutoff prediction

task in Section 5.3 and Section 5.4, respectively.

EXPERIMENT SETUP

Collections. We conduct our evaluation experiments on two para-

graph retrieval collections. The first is the MS MARCO Passage Re-

ranking collection [30]. In total, the development set of MS MARCO

comprises 8,841,822 documents, and 55,578 queries. We follow the

setting in Hofstätter et al. [13] and split the queries into a valida-

tion and a test set, containing 6,980 and 48,598 queries, respectively.

Since the provided relevance judgements by this collection are

highly sparse, we refer to this test set as SPARSE. The second test

collection is the TREC Deep Learning Track 2019 Passage Retrieval


set (TREC-19) [6], which also originates from the MS MARCO col-

lection. The TREC-19 collection encompasses 43 annotated queries.

Generative deep ranking models. Within the proposed generative

neural re-ranking framework, we investigate Seq2SeqAttention,

Transf2Transf, BERT2Transf, PGN, and T-PGN.

Matching models. For the sake of a well rounded performance

evaluation, we sample a number of IR models to compare genera-

tive models to: Kernel-based Neural Ranking Model (KNRM) [50]

Convolutional KNRM (ConvKNRM) [7], MatchPyramid [34], and

two most recent Transformer-based models: Transformer-Kernel

(TK) [14] and the fine-tuned BERT model [8]. This list is indeed

non-comprehensive, since our central aim is to investigate model

architectures within the neural generative paradigm. We conduct

experiments on BM25 as a classical matching model.

Model configuration and training. To provide a fair comparison,

we aim to select similar configurations for the different models. Ev-

ery model using pre-trained word embeddings (Seq2SeqAttention,

PGN, T-PGN, Transf2Transf, and TK) operates with the same set

of pre-trained GloVe [35] vectors of length 300. For models with

BERT (BERT, BERT2Transf), we investigate a recently-released ver-

sion of the pre-trained language model known as BERT-Tiny [46],

which has two layers of Transformers, two attention heads on each

layer, an intermediate feed-forward layer of size 512, and a final

(sub)word embedding of size 128. While much smaller, this model

has shown competitive performance in various language process-

ing tasks [46] in comparison with the larger versions of BERT,

making it suitable for conducting large-scale experiments with

various hyper-parameter settings. We set the setting of all other

model with Transformer networks (TK, T-PGN, and Transf2Transf)

to the same one as BERT-Tiny. Models that contain BERT (BERT,

BERT2Transf) utilize WordPiece tokenization. All state-of-the-art

models are trained with their recommended loss functions, namely

Cross Entropy (CE) for BERT and Marg for the other matching mod-

els. The proposed generative models are trained using three differ-

ent loss functions: NLL, Marg and NL3U. Seq2SeqAttention and PGN

have a learning rate of 0.001. Non-BERT Transformer-based models

start from learning rates of 0.0001. BERT-based generative models

use a learning rate of 0.0001 for training the Transformer-decoder,

and 0.00003 for the pre-trained BERT encoder. The complete hy-

perparameter settings of all models are provided in the published

repository together with the source code.2

Evaluation. We evaluate the performance of all models based on

the re-ranking approach. To this end, we first compute the top 200

passages as retrieved by a BM25 model. The resulting candidate

documents are then re-ranked by each of the investigated neural

model. The final re-ranked results are evaluated using several com-

mon performance metrics, namely mean reciprocal rank (MRR),

normalized discounted cumulative gain at 10 (NDCG), and recall. To

investigate statistical significance of results, we conduct two-sided

paired 𝑡-tests (details given below). In addition, we qualitatively

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

In this section, we first show the performance evaluation results

of the various deep generative models, followed by qualitative

analysis of the query generation process. We then explore the use

of uncertainty estimates to analyze the underlying characteristics

of the model and data, followed by showing the benefit of including

uncertainty information in the cut-off prediction task.

5.1

Performance Evaluation

Evaluation results are provided in Table 1 for all assessed models.

Matching models are grouped at the top of the table, and the lower

part is dedicated to generative models. For each neural generative

model, the results on three loss functions (NLL, Marg, NL3U) are

reported. The best performance among all generative models is

marked in bold. To denote statistical significance, we first assign

each generative model a letter 𝑎 to 𝑓 (see first column of Table 1).

Each performance result of each model is also marked with super-

script letters, indicating to which other models a statistically signif-

icant difference exists. To give an example: model T-PGN trained

with loss NLL, obtaining a MRR of 0.278𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑𝑒 on the SPARSE test

set, is significantly better (in terms of MRR) than generative models

𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑 and 𝑒 which have also been trained with the same loss NLL.

Let us have a closer look at the results of generative models.

The results indicate that the models that use the copy mechanism

show the best overall performance among the generative models.

In particular, T-PGN shows significantly better results than all

other deep generative models on SPARSE, while PGN shows better

performance on TREC-19. The better performance of PGN-based

models (PGN and T-PGN) in contrast to BERT-based ones is specific

to the retrieval task, and in fact stands in contrast to the common

architectural preferences in other tasks such as machine translation

and abstractive document summarization.

The effectiveness of the PGN-based models can be traced in their

decoder architectures, particularly by comparing between PGN and

Seq2SeqAttention. While the sole difference of these two models lies

in the use of the copy mechanism, the PGN and T-PGN models show

significantly higher results with large margins. We assume that this

is due to the way that the copy mechanism in PGN-based models

approach out-of-vocabulary terms (OOVs). In fact, as observed in

previous studies [13], OOVs correspond to infrequent words that –

due to their rarity – contain crucial information for retrieval. Models

that leverage this information, therefore, reach higher performance

levels. While PGN and T-PGN both benefit from effective decoding

(in respect to these retrieval tasks), the improvement of T-PGN

on SPARSE highlights the importance of enriching the encoding

layer with Transformers which differentiates the T-PGN model

from PGN.

Inspecting results for the different loss functions used for the

deep generative models reveals that, overall, the differences be-

tween various loss functions are negligible, such that the models

using NLL (as the simplest loss function) perform generally simi-

lar to the ones with Marg or NL3U. We speculate that this is due

to the probabilistic nature of generative models, as the objective

of such models is to estimate generation probability distributions,

which (based on the results) can be achieved by solely increasing

the generation probability of relevant documents. We therefore

conclude that a generative model can effectively be trained with

the NLL loss function as the simplest choice, which has the benefit

of faster training time in comparison with other loss functions.3

3Since NLL in contrast to Marg and NL3U only processes the relevant documents.

Finally, comparing the results of deep generative models with the

state-of-the-art query-document interaction models with Trans-

formers and BERT, we observe that overall the generative models

show only marginally lower performance.4

These observations on the significant differences between var-

ious architectural choices are particularly important considering

that, as discussed in Section 2, most current studies which exploit

generative models (e.g., for tasks such as query reformulation) use

similar models to Seq2SeqAttention [41, 53, 54] or the ones that

utilize Transformers as decoder [33]. Based on our results, exploit-

ing OOV-aware models such as T-PGN can provide considerable

benefits for the corresponding final tasks.

5.2

Qualitative analysis of generated queries.

We now look at the query generation aspect of the models from

a qualitative perspective. In the current and next section, we use

T-PGN as our overall best-performing deep generative model to

generate queries in a greedy generation process. In this process, for

every position the token with the highest probability is selected

4Comparing the latency of models, it is expected that the neural generative models have

overall longer inference time due to their generation process. In particular, we observe

that the PGN-based models, due to the use of two LSTMs at encoder and decoder,

have considerably longer inference time. However, BERT2Transf, while performing

marginally lower than the PGN-based models, shows almost on-par latency to the

BERT ranker.

Table 2: Examples of passages, actual queries for which the

passage was marked relevant, and synthetic queries most

likely to be generated by T-PGN.

Example 1

Passage: Fleas are holometabolous insects, going through the four lifecycle stages of egg,

larva, pupa, and imago (adult). Adult fleas must feed on blood before they can become capable

of reproduction. Flea populations are distributed with about 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae,

and 5% adults. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host

for food a flea’s life might be as short as a few days. With ample food supply, the adult flea

will often live up to 100 days.

Actual query: how long is life cycle of flea

Generated query: how long do fleas live

Example 2

Passage: I have always wanted to become a Nurse and I have been doing some research and

came across the different Nursing ’titles’ such as RN (Registered Nurse), BSN(Bachlor’s in

Science of Nursing) NA(Nurse Assistant), CRNA (Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist), LPN

and LVN.SN = Bachelor of Science in Nursing, which is just a 4 year RN degree. Both the 2 year

and the BSN graduates sit for the exact same licensure exam and earn the same RN license.

Actual query: difference between rn and bsn

Generated query: what degree do you need to be a nurse

Example 3

Passage: The flea population is typically. made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only

5% biting adults. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight

months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime. Usual

hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoon’s, opossums,

foxes, chickens, and humans.

Actual query: how long is life cycle of flea

Generated query: how long do chickens live

from the generation probability distribution of words. The gener-

ated query in this way is a greedy approximation of the query with

the highest generation probability for the given passage.




Figure 4: Relevance versus query-level uncertainty of the T-

PGN model on TREC-19.

Table 2 shows examples of passages, provided queries in the

dataset assessed as relevant to the corresponding passages, and

the queries generated by our model. We expect that a generated

query is conceptually relevant to the given passage. Looking at

Example 1, we observe that the generated query is almost the same

as the actual relevant one. It means that the model will predict a

high relevance score of the query to the passage. Example 2 shows

the opposite situation: the generated query, while being completely

different from the actual one, is still a valid and relevant query to

the given passage. Finally, in Example 3, the same actual query

as the one in Example 1 is used but with a different (while still

relevant) passage. This example highlights a failure case where the

generated query (according to the discussed greedy approach) is

conceptually non-relevant to the passage. These examples motivate

the deeper understanding of neural generative ranking models,

while the shown cases are directly relevant to the tasks that exploit

query generation for downstream tasks [33].

5.3

Model Understanding Through the Lens of

Uncertainty

In the following, we present model- and data-related insights we ob-

tained from analyzing uncertainty estimates for the T-PGN model

(Section 3.4) to approach the following questions: (1) Is there any

connection between the model’s confidence in its query genera-

tion probability and query-document relevance estimates? (2) Are

there any patterns in the uncertainty distribution along query term

positions and, if yes, what do they indicate?

To address the first question, we start with calculating query-

level uncertainty estimates by aggregating over term-level uncer-

tainties using mean, entropy, variance, and maximum. Then, for

each query-document pair in the top-200 of a ranking list, we cal-

culate the Spearman-𝑟 correlation between each query-level un-

certainty and the predicted relevance scores. We calculate these

correlations for TREC-19, containing 8,600 query-document pairs.

The calculated correlations for mean, variance, max, and en-

tropy are -0.223, -0.206, -0.358, and -0.569, respectively. All differ-

ent uncertainty aggregation results show a negative correlation to

relevance score, indicating that a decreasing predicted relevance

score (for the documents in the lower positions in the ranking list)

increases uncertainty of the model. Figure 4 demonstrates the rel-

evance and query-level uncertainty estimates using entropy for

aggregation, because of its highest negative correlation. The plot



Figure 5: The interquartile ranges of term-level uncertainty

scores, calculated on each term position for all queries with

a given length, namely the length of 4, 6, 8, and 10. For each

query length, the last term position corresponds to the &lt;EOS&gt;

special token denoting the end of the query.

shows that uncertainty of query-document pairs with higher rele-

vance is widely spread, but the distribution tends to get focused on

a high-uncertainty area as the relevance decreases.

Considering these results, with regard to our first question, we

conclude that the model tends to exhibit higher levels of uncertainty

(in the likelihood of generating the query in query-document pairs)

for low relevance estimates. This could indicate that uncertainty

may contain additional information to relevance which can be

exploited in retrieval tasks. We return to this point in Section 5.4.

To approach the second question, using the query-document

pairs of the TREC-19 results, we average the term-level uncertainty

values over all query terms that appear in a specific position of

the queries. To make the results comparable across various query

lengths, we apply this position-level aggregation over the queries

with the same size. Figure 5 shows these term-level uncertainty

distributions for every position in queries of length 4, 6, 8, and 10

terms, where each query ends with the &lt;EOS&gt; special token. Every

box in the plot represents the interquartile range of term-level

uncertainty distribution for each position.

Looking at Figure 5, we observe two major patterns in all four

settings regarding query length: (1) All average uncertainties tend

to become lower (more confident) in the last terms of the query,

where the last term has consistently the lowest uncertainty with a

considerable drop in comparison to the uncertainty at previous term

positions. (2) The uncertainty distributions regarding the first posi-

tion have similar median values across the four settings with small

variances when compared to the distributions for other positions.


Our first observation is similar to the findings by Xu et al. [52]

in the context of abstractive text summarization. This indicates that

by observing more terms during the query generation, the model

becomes more and more certain about the distribution of possible

next terms, and this confidence has its maximum in the last term.

Our second observation is, however, in contrast to the results

reported by Xu et al. [52]. In their experiments, generative models

show the greatest interquartile range of term-level uncertainty for

earlier words in the generated sequence. This can potentially reveal

the existence of a bias in the queries of the MS MARCO training

dataset, considering that many queries in the dataset start with

question words such as what, how, and where. In fact, the persis-

tent uncertainty distributions for the first position can indicate

the limited number of unique terms in training data, with which

a query begins. This observation is inline with and reinforces the

conclusions in Hofstätter et al. [15]. However, while they show

the existence of bias in the MS MARCO collection through exten-

sive fine-grained annotation, we view this from the lens of the

uncertainty of the model on each query term position.

5.4

Cut-off Prediction with Uncertainty

Do the uncertainty estimates provide novel and complementary

information to what is provided by relevance scores? If yes, can

this information be exploited in downstream IR tasks? To answer

these questions we evaluate the expressiveness of the uncertainty

estimates in a similar fashion to Cohen et al. [5], via the cutoff

prediction task. The objective of the cut-off prediction task is to

dynamically determine a cut-off point for a ranked list of documents

in order to maximize some non-monotonic metric, in our case 𝐹1

scores. As discussed by Lien et al. [23], the task is motivated by

neural models losing confidence in their estimations as documents

become less relevant to the query. In a real-world scenario, cut-

off prediction can be used by a retrieval system to prevent users

from scraping over search results, about which the ranker is not

sufficiently confident. In such scenarios, the search engine can

switch to alternative strategies, such as applying different ranking

model or encouraging the user to reformulate the query.

To study the effect of uncertainty on this task, we follow the

same procedure as in Bahri et al. [4], namely by using the proposed

Transformer-based cut-off predictor, and comparing the perfor-

mance in terms of 𝐹1 score (see Bahri et al. [4] for more details). The

predictor receives a set of features in the sense of query-document

interactions, and for each query provides a prediction regarding

the best cut-off in its ranked list. A common feature for this task

is relevance scores, assuming that the changes in relevance can be

indicative of an optimal cut-off point [4]. In our experiments, we are

interested in examining whether adding uncertainty information

can further improve this tasks by providing new information.

We therefore conduct our experiments in two configurations:

(1) using only relevance estimation from T-PGN as single feature,

referred to as Rel; (2) adding the four query-level uncertainty es-

timates (through mean, entropy, variance, and maximum term-

level uncertainty aggregations) as additional features, referred to

as Rel+Uncertainty. To train the cut-off predictors we use the

queries of TREC-19. While this task can benefit from the large

number of the queries in SPARSE, the task intrinsically requires a

sufficient amount of relevance judgements which are not available

in the SPARSE collection. In addition to Rel and Rel+Uncertainty,

we calculate the results of a Greedy approach which provides a

naive baseline by selecting the same cut-off for all ranked lists,

chosen by maximizing the 𝐹1 score on the training set. Finally, the

Oracle model indicates the score that an ideal cut-off selection

would achieve. We report in Table 3, for each configuration, the

resulting 𝐹1 score as well as its percentage when compared to the

𝐹1 score of Oracle. For each of the configuration, the experiment

is conducted in 50 trials, where in each trial 5-fold cross validation

is applied. The final results are averaged over all trials.

Comparing results for Rel and Greedy in Table 3 – as reported in

previous studies Bahri et al. [4], Lien et al. [23] – we observe that rel-

evance information is an important signal for this task. Comparing

the results of Rel with Rel+Uncertainty we observe additional

improvements by incorporating the uncertainty information. Cal-

culating a two-sided t-test with 𝑝 &lt; 0.001 between the results of

Rel+Uncertainty and Rel confirms the significance of this im-

provement. These results substantiate the value of the uncertainty

scores, inherent in the architecture of deep generative IR models,

which provide additional actionable information for IR tasks.

CONCLUSION

We propose a modern perspective on the generative IR paradigm by

introducing novel deep generative ranking models. The introduced

models offer a solid granular probabilistic framework of neural

retrieval, which lays the foundation for estimation of additional

model-level information such as uncertainty. Proposing a novel

deep generative ranking model, T-PGN, we investigate the per-

formance of several deep generative IR models on two passage

retrieval collections. Our evaluation results show the importance

of the copy mechanism in the generative models in the context of

retrieval, as provided by the PGN and T-PGN models. We further

explore the information provided by the uncertainty estimates, and

showcase the value of such uncertainty information in a cut-off

prediction task.

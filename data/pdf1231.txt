Maximum Likelihood Estimation v.s. Bayesian

Estimation

Why Parameter Estimation in Machine Learning?

weight of the contribution 

parameter estimation

estimate

parameters

selected distribution,

Maximum Likelihood Estimation(MLE)

Likelihood Function

if every predictor is i.i.d








Log-likelihood function:

The partial derivative of every involved variable

Advantages

consistent approach

unbiased

variance is really small

Disadvantages

real-world problem is always

non-trivial

not simple

trivial

sensitive 

starting value

biases to small samples

Bayesian Estimation

https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/74082/what-is-the-difference-in-bayesian-estimate-and-maximum-

likelihood-estimate

Advantages

Good information

good estimation

Work pretty well in big data

variance is really small


Disadvantages

Wrong prior

wrong prediction

different resources

add noise

It would be great if someone found my mistake, and comment out for me either in private

note or in comment session! If you think my work is good, please gently give me

clapsssss :)

Thx for reading, and happy reading!

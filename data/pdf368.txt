Abstract

Online (also called “recursive” or “adaptive”) estimation of fixed model parameters in hidden Markov models is a

topic of much interest in times series modeling. In this work, we propose an online parameter estimation algorithm

that combines two key ideas. The first one, which is deeply rooted in the Expectation-Maximization (EM)

methodology, consists in reparameterizing the problem using complete-data sufficient statistics. The second

ingredient consists in exploiting a purely recursive form of smoothing in HMMs based on an auxiliary recursion.

Although the proposed online EM algorithm resembles a classical stochastic approximation (or Robbins–Monro)

algorithm, it is sufficiently different to resist conventional analysis of convergence. We thus provide limited results

which identify the potential limiting points of the recursion as well as the large-sample behavior of the quantities

involved in the algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is numerically evaluated through simulations

in the case of a noisily observed Markov chain. In this case, the algorithm reaches estimation results that are

comparable to those of the maximum likelihood estimator for large sample sizes. The supplemental material for this

article available online includes an appendix with the proofs of Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 stated in Section 4 as well

as the MATLAB/OCTAVE code used to implement the algorithm in the case of a noisily observed Markov chain

considered in Section 5.

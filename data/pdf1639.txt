prove that the BM25 scoring function is probabilistic?

Wiki says that this function is based on a probabilistic retrieval framework. However, how do you prove that the score is a probability. The ranking function is defined as follows:

There are various ways of computing IDF. However in an abstract sense,

IDF =

totalno.ofdocuments

no. ofdocumentswhichcontaintermqi

To me the inverse (IDF−1) appears to give a probabilistic value. I can't predict anything about the second product in the equation either.

In tests I have observed that the score gives values =&gt;0 (not something between 0 &lt;score &lt;1).

no. of documents which contain term qi

total no. of documents

is the probability that a single document, sampled uniformly from the corpus, turns out to contain the term qi.

log

n(qi)+0.5

N−n(qi)+0.5

is not a probability as it may be positive or negative (for example when n(qi) &gt;

1

2N) , and may be greater than or less than 1 in magnitude. But it may be close to the first within a restricted range of interest.

The score does not need to be a probability. Its primary purpose is for ranking documents given particular queries, and in some circumstances it can be seen as a measure of relevant information.

Given a query Q containing keywords q1,...,qn the score of the document D is given as above.

score(D,Q) =

n

∑

i=1IDF(qi).

f(qi,D) ⋅ (k1+1)

f(qi,D)+k1⋅ (1−b+b ⋅

|D|

avgdl)

where:

f(qi,D) is the frequency that keyword qi appears in document D.

|D| is the length of the document (document size).

avgdl is the average document length in the corpus (i.e. collection of documents).

k1 &amp; b are free parameters

IDF(qi) is the inverse document frequency function. This is defined as follows:

IDF(qi) =log

N−n(qi)+0.5

n(qi)+0.5

where:

N is the total number of documents in the corpus

n(qi) is the number of documents which contain keyword qi

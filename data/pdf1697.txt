Abstract

Recently, researchers have successfully augmented the language modeling approach with a well-founded framework in order to incorporate

relevance feedback. A critical problem in this framework is to estimate a query language model that encodes detailed knowledge about a user’s

information need. This paper explores several methods for query model estimation, motivated by Zhai’s generative model. The generative model is

an estimation method that maximizes the generative likelihood of feedback documents according to the estimated query language model. Focusing

on some limitations of the original generative model, we propose several estimation methods to resolve these limitations: 1) three-component

mixture model, 2) re-sampling feedback documents with document language models, and 3) sampling a relevance document from a relevance

document language model. In addition, several hybrid methods are also examined, which combine the query specific smoothing method and the

estimated query language model. In experiments, our estimation methods outperform a simple generative model, showing a significant improvement

over an initial retrieval.

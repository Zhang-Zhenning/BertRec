Graph of a hidden Markov process. We are unable to observe the actual hidden states of the system Z, and can

only observe the observable processes X. Image created by the author.

Three Classes of Problems

1. Given a set of observations X and the 3 model parameters �, A and �, calculate the occurrence

probability of the observations X.

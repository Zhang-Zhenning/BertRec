This post discusses a perspective on GANs which is not new but I think is often overlooked. I'll

use this perspective to motivate an evaluation procedure for GANs which I think is underutilized

and understudied. For setup, I'll first give a quick review of maximum likelihood estimation and

the forward KL divergence; if you're familiar with these concepts you can skip to section 3.

1 The Forward KL divergence and Maximum Likelihood

In generative modeling, our goal is to produce a model qθ(x) of some “true” underlying

probability distribution p(x). For the moment, let's consider modeling the 2D Gaussian

distribution shown below. This is a toy example; in practice we want to model extremely

complex distributions in high dimensions, such as the distribution of natural images.



We don't actually have access to the true distribution; instead, we have access to samples drawn

as x � p. Shown below are some samples from this Gaussian distribution. We want to be able to

choose the parameters of our model qθ(x) using these samples alone.




Let's fit a Gaussian distribution to these samples. This will produce our model qθ(x), which ideally

will match the true distribution p(x). To do so, we need to adjust the parameters θ (in this case,

the mean and covariance) of our Gaussian model so that they minimize some measure of the

difference between qθ(x) and the samples from p(x). In practice, we'll use gradient descent over θ

for this minimization. Let's start by using the KL divergence as a measure of the difference. Our

goal will be to minimize the KL divergence (using gradient descent) between p(x) and qθ(x) to find

the best set of parameters θ�:

θ� = arg

min

θ

KL(p(x)| |qθ(x))

= arg

min

θ

Ex�p[logp(x) − logqθ(x)]

= arg

min

θ

Ex�p[logp(x)] − Ex�p[logqθ(x)]

where the separation of terms in eqn. 3 comes from the linearity of expectation. The first term, 

Ex�p[logp(x)], is just the negative entropy of the true distribution p(x). Changing θ won't change

this quantity, so we can ignore it for the purposes of finding θ�. This is nice because we also can't

compute it in practice — it requires evaluating p(x), and we do not have access to the true

distribution. This gives us

θ� = arg

min

θ

Ex�p[logp(x)] − Ex�p[logqθ(x)]

= arg

min

θ

− Ex�p[logqθ(x)]

= arg

max

θ

Ex�p[logqθ(x)]

Eqn. 6 states that we want to find the value of θ which assigns samples from p(x) the highest

possible log probability under qθ(x). This is exactly the equation for maximum likelihood

estimation, which we have shown is equivalent to minimizing KL(p(x)| |qθ(x)). Let's see what

happens when we optimize the parameters θ of our Gaussian qθ(x) to fit the samples from p(x)

via maximum likelihood:



Looks like a good fit!

2 Model Misspecification

The above example was somewhat unrealistic in the sense that both our true distribution p(x)

and our model qθ(x) were Gaussian distributions. To make things a bit harder, let's consider the


case where our true distribution is a mixture of Gaussians:



Here's what happens when we fit a 2D Gaussian distribution to samples from this mixture of

Gaussians using maximum likelihood:



We can see that qθ(x) “spreads out” to try to cover the entirety of p(x). Why does this happen?

Let's look at the maximum likelihood equation again:

θ� = arg

max

θ Ex�p[logqθ(x)]

What happens if we draw a sample from p(x) and it has low probability under qθ(x)? As qθ(x)

approaches zero for some x � p, logqθ(x) goes to negative infinity. Since we are trying to

maximize qθ(x), this means it's really really bad if we draw a sample from p(x) and qθ(x) assigns a

low probability to it. In contrast, if some x has low probability under p(x) but high probability

under qθ(x), this will not affect maximum likelihood loss much. The result is that the estimated

model tries to cover the entire support of the true distribution, and in doing so ends up assigning

probability mass to regions of space (between the two mixture components) which have low

probability under p(x). In looser terms, this means that samples from qθ(x) might be

“unrealistic”.

3 The Reverse KL Divergence

To get around this issue, let's try something simple: Instead of minimizing the KL divergence


between p(x) and qθ(x), let's try minimizing the KL divergence between qθ(x) and p(x). This is

called the “reverse” KL divergence:

θ� = arg

min

θ

KL(qθ| |p)

= arg

min

θ

Ex�qθ[logqθ(x) − logp(x)]

= arg

min

θ

Ex�qθ[logqθ(x)] − Ex�qθ[logp(x)]

= arg

max

θ

− Ex�qθ[logqθ(x)] + Ex�qθ[logp(x)]

The two terms in equation 11 each have an intuitive description: The first term −Ex�qθ[logqθ(x)]

is simply the entropy of qθ(x). So, we want our model to have high entropy, or to put it

intuitively, its probability mass should be as spread out as possible. The second term 

Ex�qθ[logp(x)] is the log probability of samples from qθ(x) under the true distribution p(x). In

other words, any sample from qθ(x) has to be reasonably “realistic” according to our true

distribution. Note that without the first term, our model could “cheat” by simply assigning all of

its probability mass to a single sample which has high probability under p(x). This solution is

essentially memorization of a single point, and the entropy term discourages this behavior. Let's

see what happens when we fit a 2D Gaussian to the mixture of Gaussians using the reverse KL

divergence:



Our model basically picks a single mode and models it well. This solution is reasonably high-

entropy, and any sample from the estimated distribution has a reasonably high probability

under p(x), because the support of qθ is basically a subset of the support of p(x). The drawback

here is that we are basically missing an entire mixture component of the true distribution.

When might this be a desirable solution? As an example, let's consider image superresolution,

where we want to recover a high-resolution image (right) from a low-resolution version (left):



This figure was made by my colleague David Berthelot. In this task, there are multiple possible

“good” solutions. In this case, it may be much more important that our model produces a single

high-quality output than that it correctly models the distribution over all possible outputs. Of

course, reverse KL provides no control over which output is chosen, just that the distribution

learned by the model has high probability under the true distribution. In contrast, maximum


likelihood can result in a “worse” solution in practice because it might produce low-quality or

incorrect outputs by virtue of trying to model every possible outcome despite model

misspecification or insufficient capacity. Note that one way to deal with this is to train a model

with more capacity; a recent example of this approach is Glow [kingma2018], a maximum

likelihood-based model which achieves impressive results with over 100 million parameters.

4 Generative Adversarial Networks

In using the reverse KL divergence above, I've glossed over an important detail: We can't

actually compute the second term Ex�qθ[logp(x)] because it requires evaluating the true

probability p(x) of a sample x � qθ. In practice, we don't have access to the true distribution, we

only have access to samples from it. So, we can't actually use reverse KL divergence to optimize

the parameters of our model. In Section 3, I “cheated” since I knew what the true model was in

our toy problem.

So far, we have been fitting the parameters of qθ(x) by minimizing a divergence between qθ(x)

and p(x) — the forward KL divergence in Section 1 and the reverse KL divergence in Section 3.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [goodfellow2014] fit the parameters of qθ(x) via the

following objective:

θ� = arg

min

θ

max

ϕ Ex�p, ˆx�qθV(fϕ(x),fϕ(ˆx))

The first bit of this equation is unchanged: We are still choosing θ� via a minimization over θ.

What has changed is the quantity we're minimizing. Instead of minimizing over some analytically

defined divergence, we're minimizing the quantity maxϕEx�p, ˆx�qθV(fϕ(x),fϕ(ˆx)) which can be

loosely considered a “learned divergence”. Let's unpack this a bit: fϕ(x) is a neural network

typically called the “discriminator” or “critic” and is parametrized by ϕ. It takes in samples from 

p(x) or qθ(x) and outputs a scalar value. V( �, �) is a loss function which fϕ(x) is trained to

maximize. The original GAN paper used the following loss function:

V(fϕ(x),fϕ(ˆx)) = logfϕ(x) + log[1 − fϕ(ˆx)]

where fϕ(x) is required to output a value between 0 and 1.

Interestingly, if fϕ(x) can represent any function, choosing θ� via Equation 12 using the loss

function in Equation 13 is equivalent to minimizing the Jensen-Shannon divergence between p(x)

a nd qθ(x). More generally, it is possible to construct loss functions V( �, �) and critic

architectures which result (in some limit) in minimization of some analytical divergence. This can

allow for minimization of divergences which are otherwise intractable or impossible to minimize

directly. For example, [nowozin2016] showed that the following loss function corresponds to

minimization of the reverse KL divergence:

V(fϕ(x),fϕ(ˆx)) = − exp(fϕ(x)) + 1 + fϕ(ˆx)

Let's go ahead and do this in the example above of fitting a 2D Gaussian to a mixture of

Gaussians:




Sure enough, the solution found by minimizing the GAN objective with the loss function in

Equation 14 looks roughly the same as the one found by minimizing the reverse KL divergence,

but did not require “cheating” by evaluating p(x).

To re-emphasize the importance of this, the GAN framework opens up the possibility of

minimizing divergences which we can't compute or minimize otherwise. This allows learning

generative models using objectives other than maximum likelihood, which has been the

dominant paradigm for roughly a century. Maximum likelihood's ubiquity is not without good

reason — it is tractable (unlike, say, the reverse KL divergence) and has nice theoretical

properties, like its efficiency and consistency. Nevertheless, the GAN framework opens the

possibility of using alternative objectives which, for example and loosely speaking, prioritize

“realism” over covering the entire support of p(x).

As a final note on this perspective, the statements above about how GANs minimize some

underlying analytical divergence can lead people thinking of them as “just minimizing the

Jensen-Shannon (or whichever other) divergence”. However, the proofs of these statements rely

on assumptions that don't hold up in practice. For example, we don't expect fϕ(x) to have the

ability to represent any function for any reasonable neural network architecture. Further, we

perform the maximization over ϕ via gradient ascent, which for neural networks is not

guaranteed to converge to any kind of optimal solution. As a result, stating that GANs are simply

minimizing some analytical divergence is misleading. To me, this is actually another thing that

makes GANs interesting, because it allows us to imbue prior knowledge about our problem in

our “learned divergence”. For example, if we use a convolutional neural network for fϕ(x), this

suggests some amount of translation invariance in the objective minimized by qθ(x), which might

be a useful structural prior for modeling the distribution of natural images.

5 Evaluation

One appealing characteristic of maximum likelihood estimation is that it facilitates a natural

measure of “generalization”: Assuming that we hold out a set of samples from p(x) which were

not used to train qθ(x) (call this set xtest), we can compute the likelihood assigned by our model to

these samples:

Ex�p[logqθ(x)] ≈

1

|xtest| ∑

x�xtestlogqθ(x)

If our model assigns a similar likelihood to these samples as it did to those it was trained on, this

suggests that it has not “overfit”. Note that Equation 15 simply computes the divergence used to

train the model (ignoring the data entropy term, which is independent of the model) over xtest.


Typically, the GAN framework is not thought to allow this kind of evaluation. As a result, various

ad-hoc and task-specific evaluation functions have been proposed (such as the Inception Score

and the Frechet Inception Distance for modeling natural images). However, following the

reasoning above actually provides a natural analog to the evaluation procedure used for

maximum likelihood: After training our model, we train an “independent critic” (used only for

evaluation) from scratch on our held-out set of samples from p(x) and samples from qθ(x) with θ

held fixed:

max

ϕ Ex�p, ˆx�qθV(fϕ(x),fϕ(ˆx)) ≈

max

ϕ

1

|xtest| ∑

x�xtestEˆx�qθV(fϕ(x),fϕ(ˆx))

Both Equation 15 and Equation 16 compute the divergence used for training our model over the

samples in xtest. Of course, Equation 16

requires training a neural network from scratch, but it nevertheless loosely represents the

divergence we used to find the parameters θ

.

While not widely used, this evaluation procedure has seen some study, for example in

[danihelka2017] and [im2018]. In recent work [gulrajani2018], we argue that this evaluation

procedure facilitates some notion of generalization and include some experiments to gain better

insight into its behavior. I plan to discuss this work in a future blog post.

6 Pointers

The perspective given in this blog post is not new. [theis2015] and [huszar2015] both discuss

the different behavior of maximum likelihood, reverse KL, and GAN-based training in terms of

support coverage. Huszár also has a few follow-up blog posts on the subject [huszar2016a],

[huszar2016b]. [poole2016] further develops the use of the GAN framework for minimizing

arbitrary f-divergences. [fedus2017] demonstrates how GANs are not always minimizing some

analytical divergence in practice. [huang2017] provides some perspective on the idea that the

design of the critic architecture allows us to imbue task-specific priors in our objective. Finally,

[arora2017] and [liu2017] provide some theory about the “adversarial divergences” learned and

optimized in the GAN framework.

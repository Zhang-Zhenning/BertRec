Ranking algorithms — know your multi-criteria

decision solving techniques!

Let’s go through some of the basic algorithms to solve complex decision-making problems

influenced by multiple criteria. We will discuss why we need such techniques and explore

available algorithms in the cool skcriteria python package

Introduction

N 








Dataset

10 rows from the cars dataset

describing each of the numerical columns (the attributes) of the selected data

Generic methodology


Maximize and Minimize

normalization logic for maximizing and minimizing an attribute values

Example for sum normalization heatmap of the original data. Check the ‘mpg’ value of ‘ford torino’. Originally its 17

but after sum normalization, it should be 17/156=0.109. Similarly, the ‘price’ is 20k, after inverse it will be

1/(20k/287872) = 14.4

Apply weights

weight modification logic

Combine the scores

Implementation

Bayes' Theorem with multiple random variables

Asked 9 years, 6 months ago

I'm reviewing some notes regarding probability, and the section regarding Conditional Probability gives the following example:

P(X,Y|Z) =

P(Z|X,Y)P(X,Y)

P(Z)

=

P(Y,Z|X)P(X)

P(Z)

The middle expression is clearly just the application of Bayes' Theorem, but I can't see how the third expression is equal to the second. Can someone please clarify how the two are equal?

We know

P(X,Y) =P(X)P(Y|X)

and

P(Y,Z|X) =P(Y|X)P(Z|X,Y)

(to understand this, note that if you ignore the fact that everything is conditioned on X then it is just like the first example).

Therefore

P(Z|X,Y)P(X,Y) =P(Z|X,Y)P(X)P(Y|X)

=P(Y,Z|X)P(X)

Which derives the third expression from the second.

(However I don't have any good intuition for what the third expression means. Does anyone else?)

We have

P(X,Y ∣ Z)

Considering X and Y as a single event, we call them A. Now we have

P(A ∣ Z) =P(X,Y ∣ Z)

Using the Joint Probabilities Rule, we have

P(A,Z) =P(A ∣ Z)×P(Z)

So we can say that

P(A ∣ Z) =

P(A,Z)

P(Z)

We know that

P(A,Z) =P(Z,A)

Again using the Joint Probabilities Rule, we have

P(Z,A) =P(Z ∣ A)×P(A)

We defined P(A) as the following

P(A) =P(X,Y)

Again using the Joint Probabilities Rule, we have

P(X,Y) =P(X ∣ Y)×P(Y)

Plugging (8) into (7), we have

P(A) =P(X ∣ Y)×P(Y)

Plugging (9) into (6), we have

P(Z,A) =P(Z ∣ A)×P(X ∣ Y)×P(Y)

Plugging (10) into (5) we have

P(A,Z) =P(Z ∣ A)×P(X ∣ Y)×P(Y)

Plugging (11) into (4), we have

P(A ∣ Z) =

P(Z ∣ A)×P(X ∣ Y)×P(Y)

P(Z)

Plugging (12) into (2), we have

P(X,Y ∣ Z) =

P(Z ∣ A)×P(X ∣ Y)×P(Y)

P(Z)

Observe that in (13), using the Joint Probabilities Rule, we have

P(X,Y) =P(X ∣ Y)×P(Y)

Since we defined P(A) is P(X,Y), we have

P(A) =P(X ∣ Y)×P(Y)

Plugging (15) into (13), we have

P(X,Y ∣ Z) =

P(Z ∣ A)×P(A)

P(Z)

Observe that in (16), using the Joint Probabilities Rule, we have

P(Z ∣ A) =

P(Z,A)

P(A)

Plugging (17) into (16), we have

P(X,Y ∣ Z) =

P(Z,A)

P(Z)

Now observe the following

P(Z,A) =P(Z,X,Y) =P(Y,Z,X)

Similar to what we did at the beginning, treating Y and Z as a single event and using the Joint Probabilities Rule, we have

P(Y,Z,X) =P(Y,Z ∣ X)×P(X)

Plugging (20) into (19), we have

P(Z,A) =P(Y,Z ∣ X)×P(X)

Plugging (21) into (18), we have

P(X,Y ∣ Z) =

P(Y,Z ∣ X)×P(X)

P(Z)

I don't know if this clarifies or complicates things more but nevertheless I wanted to include this here as well.

Right now, I can't prove why treating multiple joint events as if they were a single event is "legal".

Can you explain why (5) P(A,Z) = P(Z,A). I don't understand why this is the same

@MrBonjour Oh, actually I don't have a rigorous proof for that but it simply states that: "Probability of occurrence of A AND B together is the same as probability of occurrence of B AND A together.". As I said, I don't have a

rigorous proof for it but both sides of the equation state: "The probability of occurrence of two (given) events at the same time.". Since they are occurring at the same time, I don't think that specifying an order to this has a

meaning. So this might be a casual explanation for that.

Ok thank you. Actually I'm agree with your explanation. By the way your previous example give me a good grasp of the equation. Thank you again

P(A,Z)=P(Z,A) because events Z and A are independent, not because they are simultaneous or not. If A and Z are not independent, then this equality is not true. Example of not independent events that occur simultaneously: A =

encounter a person with long hair, Z = encounter a woman

It is easy to follow the following argumentation

P(Z|X,Y)P(X,Y) =

P(X,Y,Z)

P(X,Y) P(X,Y) =P(X,Y,Z) =

P(X,Y,Z)

P(X)

P(X) =P(Y,Z|X)P(X).

I have to say that I found this explanation the easiest to follow, even so for the original, one-line version preceding the edit. Clearly, some folks might have taken offense with @royli prefacing his answer with "Isn't this

obvious?" but for me, when explained that way, it was obvious!

I see this type of language all the time in lecture notes from the CS dept at my university... I think it's a stylistic trend. however, it drives me crazy. Oftentimes the claim is not "easy" or "trivial to see" or "obvious" in my

opinion.

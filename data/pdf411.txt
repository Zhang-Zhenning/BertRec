Topic Modeling

Topic modeling is used to analyze clusters of "topics" or co-occurring words in a text or series of texts, often with the aim of

understanding recurring themes.

Tools

 

Out-of-the-Box

MALLET

For statistical natural language processing, document classification, clustering, topic modeling, information extraction,

and other machine learning applications to text

Topic Modeling Tool

For Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling

Factorie

For natural language processing and information integration such as segmentation, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging,

named entity recognition, dependency parsing, mention finding, coreference, lexicon-matching, and latent Dirichlet

allocation

jsLDA

For in-browser topic modeling

Programmatic

Python

Genism

For latent semantic analysis (LSA, LSI, SVD), unsupervised topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet allocation; LDA), embeddings

(fastText, word2vec, doc2vec), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), and term frequency–inverse document frequency

(tf-idf)

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

For accessing corpora and lexicons, tokenization, stemming, (part-of-speech) tagging, parsing, transformations,

translation, chunking, collocations, classification, clustering, topic segmentation, concordancing, frequency distributions,

sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, probability distributions, semantic reasoning, evaluation metrics,

manipulating linguistic data (in SIL Toolbox format), language modeling, and other NLP tasks

spaCy

For tokenization, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, sentence segmentation, text

classification, lemmatization, morphological analysis, entity linking and more

scikit-learn

For classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing

NLP Architect

For word chunking, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, intent extraction, sentiment classification, language

models, transformations, Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), joint intent detection and slot tagging, noun phrase

embedding representation (NP2Vec), most common word sense detection, relation identification, cross document

coreference, noun phrase semantic segmentation, term set expansion, topics and trend analysis, optimizing NLP/NLU

models

Top2Vec

For topic modeling, semantic search, and word and document embeddings

R

tidytext

For converting to and from non-tidy formats, word and document frequency analysis (tf-idf), n-grams and correlations,

sentiment analysis with tidy data, and topic modeling

topicmodels 

For Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models and Correlated Topics Models (CTM) by David M. Blei and co-authors and the

C++ code for fitting LDA models using Gibbs sampling by Xuan-Hieu Phan and co-authors; provides an interface to the C

code

BTM 

For identifying topics in texts from term-term cooccurrences (hence 'biterm' topic model, BTM)

topicdoc 

For LDA and CTM topic models to assist in evaluating topic quality; provide topic-specific diagnostics

lda 

For Latent Dirichlet Allocation and related models similar to LSA and topic models

stm (Structural Topic Model)

For implementing a topic model derivate that can include document-level meta-data; also includes tools for model

selection, visualization, and estimation of topic-covariate regressions

text2vec 

For text vectorization, topic modeling (LDA, LSA), word embeddings (GloVe), and similarities

mscstexta4r

For sentiment analysis, topic detection, language detection, and key phrase extraction; provides an interface to the

Microsoft Cognitive Services Text Analytics API

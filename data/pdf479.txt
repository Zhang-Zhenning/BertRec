Capturing term dependencies using a language model based on sentence trees





We describe a new probabilistic Sentence Tree Language Modeling approach that captures term dependency patterns in Topic

Detection and Tracking's (TDT) Story Link Detection task. New features of the approach include modeling the syntactic structure of

sentences in documents by a sentence-bin approach and a computationally efficient algorithm for capturing the most significant

sentence-level term dependencies using a Maximum Spanning Tree approach, similar to Van Rijsbergen's modeling of document-

level term dependencies.The new model is a good discriminator of on-topic and off-topic story pairs providing evidence that sentence-

level term dependencies contain significant information about relevance. Although runs on a subset of the TDT2 corpus show that the

model is outperformed by the unigram language model, a mixture of the unigram and the Sentence Tree models is shown to improve

on the best performance especially in the regions of low false alarms.

Recognize speech.

Recognize multi-token named entities


Models

 

Independent.

Example I1:

Python Code I1

def __init__(self):

def train(self,words):

def Q(self,word):

def P(self, words):

Exercise I1

First-order Markov Model.

Example 1M1: 

⅓

Python Code 1M1

def __init__(selfs):

def train(self,words):

def Q(self,word,previous_word):

def P(words):

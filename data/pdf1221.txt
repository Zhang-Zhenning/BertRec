Reviewer: Fabrizio Sebastiani

In the last ten years, information retrieval (IR) has evolved from a niche field into an important and multifaceted discipline,

and has produced measurable results that affect the daily life of millions. No less important, its theoretical foundations have

been substantially advanced by a new research paradigm based on language modeling (LM). In September 2002, a group of

leading researchers in IR and LM gathered for a two-day workshop with the goal of discussing the current status of IR and

answering some basic questions: Where are we__?__ Where do we need to go__?__ How can LM help__?__ This paper is

a final report from that workshop, edited by Allan and Croft, and taken from the contributions of all 36 participating

researchers. It consists of two main sections: one on long-term challenges, and one on short-term issues. In the first section,

two main grand challenges for IR are identified: global information access, namely, satisfying complex and diverse types

information needs by integrating diverse sources of structured and unstructured data; and contextual retrieval, namely,

leveraging knowledge of the user context in order to always provide the right results in the right context. In the second

section, 11 major subfields of IR are analyzed: retrieval models; cross-lingual retrieval; Web search; user modeling for IR;

filtering, topic detection and tracking, and classification; summarization; question answering; metasearch and distributed

retrieval; multimedia retrieval; information extraction; and testbeds. Each is discussed by first briefly introducing what the

subfield is about, then by describing its short-term challenges, highlighting the resources needed to meet these challenges,

and discussing how LM can help. The report is very well written and well structured. Unusually for an edited work, it is also

very even in its treatment of the various subfields of IR, each of which gets the same amount of space, and each of which is

discussed in clear prose, at the same level of granularity. This paper will be of great interest to all IR researchers, and in

general, to anyone wishing to know where IR is and where its next research avenues are going to lead. Above all, this report is

a resource of exceptional value for policy makers concerned with the development of the global information society in the

next several decades. Online Computing Reviews Service

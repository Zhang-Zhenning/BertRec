∩

Conditional Probability:

Venn diagram showing the ‘space’ of outcomes of 2 events A and B. In the diagram the 2 events overlap. This

overlap represents the joint probability, i.e. the probability of both event A and event B happening. If there was no

overlap between the events then the joint probability would be zero.

Linking the probability types: The general multiplication rule

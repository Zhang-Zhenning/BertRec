On the Convergence Properties of the EM

Algorithm

Abstract

Two convergence aspects of the EM algorithm are studied: (i) does the EM algorithm find a local maximum or a

stationary value of the (incomplete-data) likelihood function? (ii) does the sequence of parameter estimates

generated by EM converge? Several convergence results are obtained under conditions that are applicable to

many practical situations. Two useful special cases are: (a) if the unobserved complete-data specification can be

described by a curved exponential family with compact parameter space, all the limit points of any EM sequence

are stationary points of the likelihood function; (b) if the likelihood function is unimodal and a certain differentiability

condition is satisfied, then any EM sequence converges to the unique maximum likelihood estimate. A list of key

properties of the algorithm is included.

User Decisions

• When should a user stop searching?

• What search strategy should a user undertake? 

– Examine lots of documents per query, and issue few 

queries

– Or examine few documents per query, and issue 

many queries

• Is it better to query or use relevance feedback?

• How many terms should a user put into a 

query?

4


User Decisions

• Should a user re-find or bookmark?

• Should a user browse for an app or search for 

an app?

– At what point does searching become more 

efficient that browsing?

• When should  a user speak to a conversational 

interface or type?

5


Designer Decisions

• How good do recommendations need to be?

• How many results should be shown per page?

• Should we present entity cards or not?

• What query suggestions should we present?

• How much space should we dedicate to 

advertisements on a web page?

• How can we summarize the feed better?

• Should people use duckduckgo or google?

But, what about you? 


• Valuing new services; new features

• Applying economics models to accessibility problems, 

usability tests, information presentation, (user 

populations) +3

• Decisions&amp;trade-offs b/w complexity/functionalities 

and simplicity + 2

• Interfaces to manipulate user behavior

• Collaborative environments – also agents+humans + 2

• User understanding

• Evaluation measures of interactions

• Comparisons of interactions

8


Decisions, Decisions!

• When would a user pay $10/month for Spotify?

• What is the best army composition in Clash of 

Clans: Archers, Barbarians and/or Giants?

• Should a player farm the jungle, stay in lane, or 

gank?

• How many ads should we put on the interface?

• What is the value of the cookie law?

• When will a user switch from mobile to desktop?

• How can we improve conversation over skype?

• What features should be included in the app?

Tutorial’s Motivations

Why make economic models of 

Computer Human Interaction?

Economics provides us with the tools to:

– Understand of how people interact with systems

– Predict how people will adapt and respond to system 

changes 

– Evaluate the value/utility of features and interactions

– Inform the design and development of interfaces 

10


Tutorial’s Goals

Give you the knowledge and skills to:

• Define and describe the different types of models 

• Explain the rationale for economics models of 

CHI 

• Describe and define the economic (optimization) 

models for UX/UI design 

• Explain and infer the predicted user behavior 

given these models 

• Generate hypotheses regarding user behavior

EXAMPLE


How do users behave

searching for information?


Users behaving…







Typically pose short queries (2-3 terms)

Tend to only examine first 

few results

Users behaving… 

17


Users behaving…







Typically pose short queries (2-3 terms)

But longer queries yield better performance

Tend to only examine first 

few results

And going deeper 

provides more relevant 

information

Users behaving… 

18


Users behaving…







Typically pose short queries (2-3 terms)

Are they “misbehaving”? 

But longer queries yield better performance

Tend to only examine first 

few results

And going deeper 

provides more relevant 

information

Users behaving… badly?

And going deeper 

provides more relevant 

information

Are they being strategic?

How can we improve search, 

if we don’t understand users?

Users behaving… badly?

Users behaving… optimally?

Why do users behave like this?


THEORY AND MODELS




Types of Models

• Descriptive &amp; Conceptual

– describe the phenomena and the 

suggesting relationship between 

factors

– pre-theoretical, without directly 

testable hypotheses

• Formal &amp; Theoretical

– Often mathematical, explicitly 

defining the relationships among 

factors (functionally)

– More than just predictive, but 

explanatory

– Produce testable hypotheses





LACK 

EXPLANATORY 

POWER





CAN BE USED 

TO EXPLAIN 

WHY!

Jarvelin (2011)

Jarvelin (2003)

23


Current Approach to HCI

• HCI is largely empirical &amp; observational

–Very good at cataloguing what users do, and 

at eliciting user requirements

• not “formal theory” driven!

–Few formal models

–The models usually come after the design, 

the experiments

–Not good at explaining why!

Bates’ Berry Picking Models

































Bates (1989)



An example of a conceptual model

Descriptive models  

are useful.

But we need models 

that are also 

predictive and 

explanatory.

26


Human Computer Interaction needs formal models to: 

• describe, predict and explain user behaviors

• provide a basis on which to reason about interaction,

• understand the relationships between interaction, 

performance and cost,

• help guide the design, development and research of 

information systems, interfaces and agents and

• derive laws and principles of interaction

• e.g. Fitt’s Law, Hicks’ Law

Major Research Challenge

Solution: Economics


ECONOMIC THINKING

Some core concepts




Scarcity and Choice

• People always want more! Unlimited Wants!

– I want to see all the CHI papers 

– I want to upgrade all the Pokemons

• But, people often don’t have enough resources

– I don’t have enough time, candy, energy, etc.

• There aren’t enough resources to go around or 

satisfy all our needs and desires.

– This leads to trade-offs

29


Poverty of Attention

“What information consumes is rather 

obvious: it consumes the attention of its 

recipients. 

Hence a wealth of information creates a 

poverty of attention, and a need to 

allocate that attention efficiently among 

the overabundance of information sources 

that might consume it.”

Simon (1955)

A Tutorial on Models of Information Seeking, Searching &amp; Retrieval by @leifos &amp; @guidozuc

30


Scarcity and Choice

• Economics is the study of how people

– choose to use their scarce resources in an attempt 

to satisfy their unlimited wants.

– And the trade-offs and choices that people make, 

given the fact of scarcity

– I’ll upgrade Pikachu and not Eevee

• People make decisions in their own self-

interest, weighing benefits and costs.

– 2 pcs candies to power up to get few more 

combat points VS. 25 pcs to evolve and get special 

abilities and a new Pokemon

31


Resources

• Four types of productive resources 

– Resources have to be able to produce something

– Land: any natural resource

– Economic Capital: anything that’s manufactured 

in order to be used in the production of goods and 

services

– Labor: any human service (physical or intellectual)

– Entrepreneurship: the ability of someone to 

recognize or look for opportunities, organize the 

other factors of productions and take risk

32


Opportunity Cost

• Limited resources, means making a choice

about how to use them

– When you choose one option, you forego other 

options

– Opportunity Cost 

• indicates what must be given up to obtain something 

that else

• And is the value of the next best alternative

– Since people must choose, they inevitably face 

trade-off

• Provides a means for reasoning about how 

good/bad a decision is

33


Division of Labor

• The way a good or service is produced can 

often be divided into a number of tasks

– These can be performed by different workers

• This lead to specialization

– In MOBAs like DOTA, players specialize (supports, 

mid, carries, feeders, noobs, etc.)

34


Division of Labor

• Specialization enables economics of scale

– As the level of production increases, the average 

cost of producing each unit declines.

• The division and specialization of labor has 

been a force against the problem of scarcity.

– Especially in collaborative environments, we need 

therefore to be mindful of how people/agents are 

specializing (or not)

– Write a document in Word, different roles are 

“supported” through different 

views/menus/ribbons

35


Micro vs Macro

• Microeconomics: focuses on the actions of 

individuals

– What determines how people allocate their budget?

– What combination of interactions/services best fits 

their wants?

– How should people and agents work together?

• Macroeconomics: focuses on the 

economy/ecosystem as a whole, i.e. the 

population level

– E.g. filter bubbles, algorithmic bias, popularity bias

– The Attention Economy

36


Why is Attention Scarce?

37



Over Time

Information Supply &amp; Consumed

The fraction of information that is 

actually consumed will, with time, 

approach zero

Exponential 

growth in 

information 

available

Information 

consumed 

grows at linear 

rate


Economic Models

• Economic Model: a simplified version of 

reality that allows us to observe, understand 

and make predictions about behavior

• An Economic Model takes a complex real-

world situation and boils it down to the 

essentials

– it could be a narrative model, e.g. law of demand

– here we will mostly focus on mathematical models

• E.g. Formal Models

38


• a ruthless abstraction of reality

• marginalize the user &amp; ignore context

• contain math &amp; equations &amp; formulas

• contain math &amp; equations &amp; formulas

• look scary and are intimidating

• not very explained well

• appear complex &amp; are hard to interpret

• Often difficult to operationalize in practice

39

Perceived Problems w/ Formal Models


Benefits of Formal Models

• a ruthless abstraction of reality

• focus on the salient variables

• precisely relate these variables together

– And so are often mathematical

• produce testable hypotheses

• can be elegant, insightful &amp; beautiful

• intellectually, they are desirable

– they can ground our science

40


Why don’t we have lots of formal models?

• Often it is hard to understand what is going on?

– Different contexts/users, many observed behaviors

– Same context, many observed behaviors

• Too many variables, too complex

– Often we throw our hands up at the problem

– Its impossible, people are unpredictable

• There is general belief that is can’t be done

– Yet, we can model the universe, but not people?

41


Why don’t we have lots of formal models?

• Abstraction is hard. Abstraction is really hard

• Modeling requires a deep understanding of 

the process and tasks

– Often pre-theoretical work needs to be performed 

a priori

– Background knowledge is needed

– Observations are required to developed intuitions

• They are scary – BOO!

42


What is next?

• Now: 

– Formalizing intuitions – usability guidelines

• Next: 

– Building Cost Models

– Performing Cost Benefit Analysis

– Comparing Features/Methods

– Defining Optimization Models to explore trade-offs

• Then:

– Examples and the practical session

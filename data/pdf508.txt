Three fundamental problems of HMM

← Page 1 Page 2 Page 3 →

For the HMM to be useful in real-world applications in solving problems like sequence labeling,

following three fundamental problems to be solved;

Evaluation problem: Given an HMM λ = (A, B, π) and an observation sequence O = o1, o2,

…, oT, how do we compute the probability that the observed sequence was produced by

the model. In other words, it is about determining the likelihood of the observation

sequence.

Question answered by Evaluation problem: What is the probability that a

particular sequence of symbols is produced by a particular model?

What is it? – More details here

Decoding problem: Given an HMM λ = (A, B, π) and an observation sequence O = o1, o2,

…, oT, how do we choose the corresponding optimal hidden state sequence (most likely

sequence) Q = q1, q2, …, qT that can best explain the observations.

Question answered by Decoding problem: Given a sequence of symbols (your

observa�ons) and a model, what is the most likely sequence of states that produced

the sequence. 

What is it? - More details here

Learning problem: Given a sequence of observation O = o1, o2, …, oT, estimate the

transition and emission probabilities that are most likely to give O. that is, using the

observation sequence and HMM general structure, determine the HMM model λ = (A, B,

π) that best fit training data.

Question answered by Learning problem: Given a model structure and a set of

sequences, find the model that best fits the data.

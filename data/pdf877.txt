Abstract

We discuss the problem of ranking k instances with the use of a "large margin" principle. We introduce two main

approaches: the first is the "fixed margin" policy in which the margin of the closest neighboring classes is being

maximized - which turns out to be a direct generaliza(cid:173) tion of SVM to ranking learning. The second approach

allows for k - 1 different margins where the sum of margins is maximized. This approach is shown to reduce to lI-SVM

when the number of classes k = 2. Both approaches are optimal in size of 21 where I is the total number of training

examples. Experiments performed on visual classification and "collab(cid:173) orative filtering" show that both

approaches outperform existing ordinal regression algorithms applied for ranking and multi-class SVM applied to

general multi-class classification.

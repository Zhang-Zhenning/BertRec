Palm oil is a seed crop which is widely adopt for food and non-food products such as cookie, vegetable oil,

cosmetics, household products and others. Palm oil is majority growth in Malaysia and Indonesia. However, the

demand for palm oil is getting growth and rapidly running out over the years. This phenomenal cause illegal

logging of trees and destroy the natural habitat. Hence, the present paper investigates the relationship between

exchange rate and palm oil price in Malaysia by using Maximum Likelihood Estimation via Newton-Raphson

algorithm to fit a two components mixture model. Besides, this paper proposes a mixture of normal distribution

to accommodate with asymmetry characteristics and platykurtic time series data.

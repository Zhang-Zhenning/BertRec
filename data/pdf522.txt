the starting alpha is the product of probabilities of the emission and the initial state

Hold on! Why the alpha and the beta functions?

smoothing

The denominator term is a normalization constant and is usually dropped like this because it does not

depend on the state, and therefore it is not important when comparing the probability of different states at

any time k.

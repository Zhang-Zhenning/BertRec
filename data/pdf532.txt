Robust Classification using Hidden Markov Models and Mixtures of Normalizing

Flows

Anubhab Ghosh, Antoine Honoré, Dong Liu, Gustav Eje Henter, Saikat Chatterjee

We test the robustness of a maximum-likelihood (ML) based classifier where sequential data as observation is corrupted by noise. The

hypothesis is that a generative model, that combines the state transitions of a hidden Markov model (HMM) and the neural network based

probability distributions for the hidden states of the HMM, can provide a robust classification performance. The combined model is called

normalizing-flow mixture model based HMM (NMM-HMM). It can be trained using a combination of expectation-maximization (EM) and

backpropagation. We verify the improved robustness of NMM-HMM classifiers in an application to speech recognition.

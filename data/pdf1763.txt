In this paper, an introduction and survey over probabilistic information retrieval (IR) is given. First, the basic

concepts of this approach are described: the probability-ranking principle shows that optimum retrieval quality

can be achieved under certain assumptions; a conceptual model for IR along with the corresponding event space

clarify the interpretation of the probabilistic parameters involved. For the estimation of these parameters, three

different learning strategies are distinguished, namely query-related, document-related and description-related

learning. As a representative for each of these strategies, a specific model is described. A new approach regards

IR as uncertain inference; here, imaging is used as a new technique for estimating the probabilistic parameters,

and probabilistic inference networks support more complex forms of inference. Finally, the more general

problems of parameter estimations, query expansion and the development of models for advanced document

representations are discussed.

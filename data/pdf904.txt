Problem Definition

R = (R1, R2, R3 …)

fθ(R1) ≥ fθ(R2) ≥ fθ(R3) ≥ . . . 

d � D �� d � R

Pointwise Learning to Rank

optimising for being close to label and not

for ranking documents

Pairwise Learning to Rank

based on pairs

of documents with difference in relevance

hinge loss will push the score of the relevant document to be greater than the less

relevant document

does not look at the pairs it’s trying to fix and where they are in ranking

Listwise Learning to Rank

optimise this metric directly


log2 (rank(di) + 1) is not differentiable

now there is a weight according (defined by log()

term in equation) to which how much DCG changes (defined by absolute delta of DCG)

when you switch a pair

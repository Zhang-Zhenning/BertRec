Abstract

This introduction to the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm provides an intuitive and mathematically rigorous understanding

of EM. Two of the most popular applications of EM are described in detail: estimating Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), and

estimating hidden Markov models (HMMs). EM solutions are also derived for learning an optimal mixture of fixed models, for

estimating the parameters of a compound Dirichlet distribution, and for dis-entangling superimposed signals. Practical issues that

arise in the use of EM are discussed, as well as variants of the algorithm that help deal with these challenges.

Theory and Use of the EM Algorithm

Theory and Use of the EM Algorithm introduces the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and provides an intuitive and

mathematically rigorous understanding of this method. It describes in detail two of the most popular applications of EM: estimating

Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), and estimating hidden Markov models (HMMs). It also covers the use of EM for learning an

optimal mixture of fixed models, for estimating the parameters of a compound Dirichlet distribution, and for disentangling

superimposed signals. It discusses problems that arise in practice with EM, and variants of the algorithm that help deal with these

challenges. Theory and Use of the EM Algorithm is designed to be useful to both the EM novice and the experienced EM user

looking to better understand the method and its use.

Conditional probability constraints

Suppose I want to set an exam question on conditional probability. There will be two events (not necessarily independent) A and B, so the question will contain the usual expressions: P(A),P(A|B),P(A∩B) etc.

1) Let's say I fix the values of P(A) and P(B|A). What are the constraints I have to set on P(B) in terms of these probabilities?

2) For fixed P(B|A) and P(B| ˉA), what will now be the constraints on P(B)?

From Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) =

P(B|A)P(A)

P(B)

so for (1) I need to figure out what would be the physical conditions for

P(A|B) =

P(A∩B)

P(B)

If A and B are independent, then P(A∩B) =P(A)P(B), so P(B) =P(B|A). I'm not sure what would be the other limit and how to proceed with 2).

P(B) =P(A∩B)+P(ˉA∩B) so

1. P(B|A)P(A) ≤P(B) ≤P(B|A)P(A)+1−P(A)

2. min (P(B|A),P(B| ˉA)) ≤P(B) ≤ max (P(B|A),P(B| ˉA))

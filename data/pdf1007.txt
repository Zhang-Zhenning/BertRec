Abstract

Bayesian methods are a class of statistical methods that have some appealing properties for solving problems in machine learning, particularly when

the process being modelled has uncertain or random aspects. In this chapter we look at the mathematical and philosophical basis for Bayesian

methods and how they relate to machine learning problems in multimedia. We also discuss the notion of decision theory, for making decisions

under uncertainty, that is closely related to Bayesian methods. The numerical methods needed to implement Bayesian solutions are also discussed.

Two specific applications of the Bayesian approach that are often used in machine learning – naïve Bayes and Bayesian networks – are then

described in more detail.

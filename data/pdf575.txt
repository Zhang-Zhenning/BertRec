What is a Hidden

Markov Model?

Markov Model?

Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a

statistical Markov model in which

the model states are hidden. It is

important to understand that the

state of the model, and not the

parameters of the model, are

hidden. A Markov model with fully

known parameters is still called a

HMM. While the model state may

be hidden, the state-dependent

output of the model is visible.

Information about the state of the

model can be gleaned from the

probability distribution over

possible output tokens because

each model state creates a

different distribution. A sequence

of output tokens will provide insight

into the sequence of states in a

process known as pattern theory.

Why is this Useful?

Why is this Useful?

The main usefulness of HMM is the

recovery of a data sequence that is

hidden by observing the output

which is dependent on that hidden

data sequence.

Example

Example

Two people, let’s call them Isla and

Donnie, talk about food they like to

eat. Donnie likes to eat pizza, pasta

and pie. He tends to choose which

to eat depending on his emotions.

Isla has a rough understanding of

the likelihood that Donnie is happy

or upset and his tendency to pick

food based on those emotions.














Donnie’s food choice is the Markov

process and Isla knows the

parameters but she does not know

the state of Donnie’s emotions;

this is a hidden Markov model.

When they talk, Isla can determine

the probability of Donnie being

either happy or upset based on

which of the three foods he chose

to eat at a given moment.

Estimation of a Two-component Mixture Model with Applications to Multiple

Testing

Rohit Kumar Patra, Bodhisattva Sen

We consider a two-component mixture model with one known component. We develop methods for estimating the mixing proportion and the

unknown distribution nonparametrically, given i.i.d.~data from the mixture model, using ideas from shape restricted function estimation. We

establish the consistency of our estimators. We find the rate of convergence and asymptotic limit of the estimator for the mixing proportion.

Completely automated distribution-free honest finite sample lower confidence bounds are developed for the mixing proportion. Connection to

the problem of multiple testing is discussed. The identifiability of the model, and the estimation of the density of the unknown distribution are

also addressed. We compare the proposed estimators, which are easily implementable, with some of the existing procedures through

simulation studies and analyse two data sets, one arising from an application in astronomy and the other from a microarray experiment.

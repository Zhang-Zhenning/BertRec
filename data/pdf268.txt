Metrics details

The expectation maximization algorithm arises in many computational biology applications that involve probabilistic models. What is it good for,

and how does it work?

Probabilistic models, such as hidden Markov models or Bayesian networks, are commonly used to model biological data. Much of their popularity

can be attributed to the existence of efficient and robust procedures for learning parameters from observations. Often, however, the only data

available for training a probabilistic model are incomplete. Missing values can occur, for example, in medical diagnosis, where patient histories

generally include results from a limited battery of tests. Alternatively, in gene expression clustering, incomplete data arise from the intentional

omission of gene-to-cluster assignments in the probabilistic model. The expectation maximization algorithm enables parameter estimation in

probabilistic models with incomplete data.

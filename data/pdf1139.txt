Text Classification Using Naive Bayes: Theory &amp; A

Working Example

In this article, I explain how the Naive Bayes works and I implement a multi-class text

classification problem step-by-step in Python.

3. Dealing with text data

However the raw data, a

sequence of symbols (i.e. strings) cannot be fed directly to the algorithms themselves as

most of them expect numerical feature vectors with a fixed size rather than the raw text

documents with variable length.

tokenizing

counting

individual token occurrence frequency

“Counting” Example (to really understand this before we move on):

[‘and’, ‘document’, ‘first’, ‘is’, ‘one’, ‘second’, ‘the’, ‘third’, ‘this’]

What Are Word Embeddings for Text?

by Jason Brownlee on October 11, 2017 in Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

Last Updated on August 7, 2019

Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation.

They are a distributed representation for text that is perhaps one of the key breakthroughs for the impressive performance of deep

learning methods on challenging natural language processing problems.

In this post, you will discover the word embedding approach for representing text data.

After completing this post, you will know:

What the word embedding approach for representing text is and how it differs from other feature extraction methods.

That there are 3 main algorithms for learning a word embedding from text data.

That you can either train a new embedding or use a pre-trained embedding on your natural language processing task.

Kick-start your project with my new book Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, including step-by-step tutorials and the

Python source code files for all examples.

Let’s get started.

What Are Word Embeddings?

A word embedding is a learned representation for text where words that have the same meaning have a similar representation.

It is this approach to representing words and documents that may be considered one of the key breakthroughs of deep learning on

challenging natural language processing problems.

— Page 92, Neural Network Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2017.

Word embeddings are in fact a class of techniques where individual words are represented as real-valued vectors in a predefined

vector space. Each word is mapped to one vector and the vector values are learned in a way that resembles a neural network, and

hence the technique is often lumped into the field of deep learning.

Key to the approach is the idea of using a dense distributed representation for each word.

Each word is represented by a real-valued vector, often tens or hundreds of dimensions. This is contrasted to the thousands or

millions of dimensions required for sparse word representations, such as a one-hot encoding.

— A Neural Probabilistic Language Model, 2003.

The distributed representation is learned based on the usage of words. This allows words that are used in similar ways to result in

having similar representations, naturally capturing their meaning. This can be contrasted with the crisp but fragile representation in a

bag of words model where, unless explicitly managed, different words have different representations, regardless of how they are used.

There is deeper linguistic theory behind the approach, namely the “distributional hypothesis” by Zellig Harris that could be summarized

as: words that have similar context will have similar meanings. For more depth see Harris’ 1956 paper “Distributional structure“.

This notion of letting the usage of the word define its meaning can be summarized by an oft repeated quip by John Firth:

One of the benefits of using dense and low-dimensional vectors is computational: the majority of neural network toolkits do

not play well with very high-dimensional, sparse vectors. … The main benefit of the dense representations is generalization

power: if we believe some features may provide similar clues, it is worthwhile to provide a representation that is able to

capture these similarities.



associate with each word in the vocabulary a distributed word feature vector … The feature vector represents different

aspects of the word: each word is associated with a point in a vector space. The number of features … is much smaller

than the size of the vocabulary



You shall know a word by the company it keeps!




— Page 11, “A synopsis of linguistic theory 1930-1955“, in Studies in Linguistic Analysis 1930-1955, 1962.

Word Embedding Algorithms

Word embedding methods learn a real-valued vector representation for a predefined fixed sized vocabulary from a corpus of text.

The learning process is either joint with the neural network model on some task, such as document classification, or is an

unsupervised process, using document statistics.

This section reviews three techniques that can be used to learn a word embedding from text data.

1. Embedding Layer

An embedding layer, for lack of a better name, is a word embedding that is learned jointly with a neural network model on a specific

natural language processing task, such as language modeling or document classification.

It requires that document text be cleaned and prepared such that each word is one-hot encoded. The size of the vector space is

specified as part of the model, such as 50, 100, or 300 dimensions. The vectors are initialized with small random numbers. The

embedding layer is used on the front end of a neural network and is fit in a supervised way using the Backpropagation algorithm.

— Page 49, Neural Network Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2017.

The one-hot encoded words are mapped to the word vectors. If a multilayer Perceptron model is used, then the word vectors are

concatenated before being fed as input to the model. If a recurrent neural network is used, then each word may be taken as one input

in a sequence.

This approach of learning an embedding layer requires a lot of training data and can be slow, but will learn an embedding both targeted

to the specific text data and the NLP task.

2. Word2Vec

Word2Vec is a statistical method for efficiently learning a standalone word embedding from a text corpus.

It was developed by Tomas Mikolov, et al. at Google in 2013 as a response to make the neural-network-based training of the

embedding more efficient and since then has become the de facto standard for developing pre-trained word embedding.

Additionally, the work involved analysis of the learned vectors and the exploration of vector math on the representations of words. For

example, that subtracting the “man-ness” from “King” and adding “women-ness” results in the word “Queen“, capturing the analogy

“king is to queen as man is to woman“.

— Linguistic Regularities in Continuous Space Word Representations, 2013.

Two different learning models were introduced that can be used as part of the word2vec approach to learn the word embedding; they

are:

Continuous Bag-of-Words, or CBOW model.

Continuous Skip-Gram Model.

The CBOW model learns the embedding by predicting the current word based on its context. The continuous skip-gram model learns

by predicting the surrounding words given a current word.

The continuous skip-gram model learns by predicting the surrounding words given a current word.

… when the input to a neural network contains symbolic categorical features (e.g. features that take one of k distinct

symbols, such as words from a closed vocabulary), it is common to associate each possible feature value (i.e., each word

in the vocabulary) with a d-dimensional vector for some d. These vectors are then considered parameters of the model,

and are trained jointly with the other parameters.



We find that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and semantic regularities in language, and

that each relationship is characterized by a relation-specific vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on

the offsets between words. For example, the male/female relationship is automatically learned, and with the induced vector

representations, “King – Man + Woman” results in a vector very close to “Queen.”






The continuous skip-gram model learns by predicting the surrounding words given a current word.



Word2Vec Training Models

Taken from “Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space”, 2013

Both models are focused on learning about words given their local usage context, where the context is defined by a window of

neighboring words. This window is a configurable parameter of the model.

— Page 128, Neural Network Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2017.

The key benefit of the approach is that high-quality word embeddings can be learned efficiently (low space and time complexity),

allowing larger embeddings to be learned (more dimensions) from much larger corpora of text (billions of words).

3. GloVe

The Global Vectors for Word Representation, or GloVe, algorithm is an extension to the word2vec method for efficiently learning word

vectors, developed by Pennington, et al. at Stanford.

Classical vector space model representations of words were developed using matrix factorization techniques such as Latent

Semantic Analysis (LSA) that do a good job of using global text statistics but are not as good as the learned methods like word2vec at

capturing meaning and demonstrating it on tasks like calculating analogies (e.g. the King and Queen example above).

GloVe is an approach to marry both the global statistics of matrix factorization techniques like LSA with the local context-based

learning in word2vec.

Rather than using a window to define local context, GloVe constructs an explicit word-context or word co-occurrence matrix using

statistics across the whole text corpus. The result is a learning model that may result in generally better word embeddings.

— GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation, 2014.

The size of the sliding window has a strong effect on the resulting vector similarities. Large windows tend to produce more

topical similarities […], while smaller windows tend to produce more functional and syntactic similarities.



GloVe, is a new global log-bilinear regression model for the unsupervised learning of word representations that outperforms

other models on word analogy, word similarity, and named entity recognition tasks.




Using Word Embeddings

You have some options when it comes time to using word embeddings on your natural language processing project.

This section outlines those options.

1. Learn an Embedding

You may choose to learn a word embedding for your problem.

This will require a large amount of text data to ensure that useful embeddings are learned, such as millions or billions of words.

You have two main options when training your word embedding:

1. Learn it Standalone, where a model is trained to learn the embedding, which is saved and used as a part of another model for

your task later. This is a good approach if you would like to use the same embedding in multiple models.

2. Learn Jointly, where the embedding is learned as part of a large task-specific model. This is a good approach if you only intend

to use the embedding on one task.

2. Reuse an Embedding

It is common for researchers to make pre-trained word embeddings available for free, often under a permissive license so that you

can use them on your own academic or commercial projects.

For example, both word2vec and GloVe word embeddings are available for free download.

These can be used on your project instead of training your own embeddings from scratch.

You have two main options when it comes to using pre-trained embeddings:

1. Static, where the embedding is kept static and is used as a component of your model. This is a suitable approach if the

embedding is a good fit for your problem and gives good results.

2. Updated, where the pre-trained embedding is used to seed the model, but the embedding is updated jointly during the training of

the model. This may be a good option if you are looking to get the most out of the model and embedding on your task.

Which Option Should You Use?

Explore the different options, and if possible, test to see which gives the best results on your problem.

Perhaps start with fast methods, like using a pre-trained embedding, and only use a new embedding if it results in better performance

on your problem.

Hi

Can you please elaborate a bit what you exactly mean with “document statistics” in the sentence below (what is it exactly about):

The learning process is either joint with the neural network model on some task, such as document classification, or is an

unsupervised process, using document statistics.

And in general both Word2Vec and GloVe are unsupervised learning, correct? In contract an example usage of Word Embedding in

supervised learning would be Spam-Mail Detection, right?

Thanks



REPLY 



Jason Brownlee January 5, 2019 at 7:00 am #

Document stats just means statistics on how words are used – ordering.

Hello, I have a question. Let say, I would like to use word embeddings (100 dimensions) with logistic regression. My

features are twitters. I want to encode them into into an array with 100 columns. Twits are not only words, but sentences containing

variable number of words. How can I bring each sentence to the same number of columns:

-&gt; average of vectors for every word in the sentence,

-&gt; sum of vectors for every word in the sentence?

Probably there are some some smarter way how to aggregate them so that they don’t lose their semantics?

Thank you in advance for your response.



REPLY 



Jason Brownlee July 19, 2019 at 9:18 am #

Ouch, logistic regression might not be great for this.

Nevertheless. One sample or tweet is multiple words. Each word is converted to a vector and the vectors are concatenated to

provide one long input to the model.

A better approach would be to use a model that support sequences, like an RNN or 1D CNN.



REPLY 




Ros July 19, 2019 at 5:46 pm #

Hello Jason, thank you for reply. Actually here I am not interested in the logistic regression � rather I would like to

understand how to encode text of different length so that it has the same vector length and can be fed to any ML algorithm.

As for concatenation of the vectors mentioned by you, here I see the problem.

Let say I have 5 words in the first sentence (tweet), then after concatenation I will have the vector of length 500.

Let assume another sentence (tweet) has 10 words so after the encoding and concatenation I will have the vector of length

1000.

So I cannot use these vectors together because they have different length (different number of columns in the table) so that

they cannot be consumed by algorithm.

Probably I misunderstood the concept of word embeddings and try to approach it as bag-of-words model � could you

suggest me some reading related to my problem because I feel that even after reading several articles on your blog and I

still haven’t found the answer to my question.

Thank you!

Ros

Jason Brownlee July 20, 2019 at 10:49 am #

Yes, typically we would choose a fixed length then trim or pad all examples to be the same length, then encode:

https://machinelearningmastery.com/data-preparation-variable-length-input-sequences-sequence-prediction/

I would recommend using a word embedding which involves encoding words as numbers then providing them as input to

the embedding followed by a CNN:

It is an increase in dimensionality over the words, and a decrease in dimensionality compared to a one hot encoding.

Hi Jason

Thank you! It was very useful to read your article.

is it possible to train more than one word embedding model for different corpora in order to compare the various embeddings

between the corpora? bear in mind that they are from the same domain, the only difference is the author characteristics.

If yes, do you have an initial thoughts about how this can be done?

I’m happy it was useful.

Yes, perhaps try it and use it as the input to a multi-input model.

Thank you very much, it was useful for me to learn about this concept of word embedding.

Thank you again.

Great article, Jason!

I’m trying to generate word embeddings for words specific to a subject but don’t have a large enough corpus to train.

Referring to the section – 2. “Reuse an Embedding”, I think that point 2 “Updated” (where the pre-trained embedding is used to

seed the model…) might be the right option for me.

Can you share some pointers on how I can Update pre-existing models with specific words with a limited corpus?

Hi Jason, thanks for this post!

to best of your knowledge, expect one-hot encoding, tokenizer API, and Word2Vec is there any other algorithms for word

embedding?

Jason Brownlee June 2, 2020 at 6:23 am #

Yes, you can use a standalone method like word2vec or glove, or learn an embedding as part of a model directly.

Hello,

thanks for the great tuto!

is BERT and xLNET are also a pre-trained word embeddings, that we can use in our model?

Jason Brownlee June 17, 2020 at 6:19 am #

BERT is a pre-trained language model.

Hi,

Great article!!.

I have a doubt, can we use word embeddings obtained using word2vec and pass it to machine learning model as a set of features ?

Actually, I am working on a Multi class classification problem. Earlier I used CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer as feature

extraction methods. Can I use word@vec instead of them and pass it on to SVM model ?

Thanks!

Hi dear Jason,

Firstly, I would to thank you about this amazing article,

Secondly, I have question,

If I want to do supervised multi-classes classification of specific domain such as history, using one of deep learning techniques.

which is the best word embddings technique should I use?

1- Word2vec based on Continuous Bag-of-Words,

2- Word2 vector based on Continuous Skip-Gram Model,

3- Glove.

Many thanks…

You’re welcome.

We cannot know a priori.

Perhaps try each with your dataset and use the method that results in best model performance.

Jason, you are “the Dude”!! Thank you so much, good man! Whenever I have a question on whatever subject in Machine

Learning, or when I don’t understand something, or when something isn’t clear, I always come here and find a good and

comprehensible answer.

Many thanks again.

Hi Jason,

Thanks for your article and I learn a lot from it.

I would like to classify the reports regarding RISK into higher or lower risk using NLP.

I was was wondering if you could advise me of any word embedding dictionary or library(which is pretrained based on a very huge

corpus text, like a lookup table and and need to pay for it). By using this, those words that have the similar meaning have a similar

representation (the most Negative meaning to the most Positive meaning regarding RISK).

Thank you, Jack

You’re welcome.

Perhaps try learning an embedding as part of the model directly – it would likely be more effective (in my experience).

I’m just starting out with word embeddings, playing around with pre-existing embeddings such as FastText. How do you

handle words that do not have any vectors assigned and returned as null values? I fear the false impact of assigning 0 to replace

the null values, or any other imputation method.

Jason Brownlee June 17, 2021 at 6:16 am #

New words not in the vocab are encoded as a vector of all zero values, e.g. “unknown”.

This in incredible. After perusing your explanation I’m now in the unique position of understanding less about word

embeddings than I did before.

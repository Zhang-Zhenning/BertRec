Information Retrieval: Recent Advances and Beyond

Kailash A. Hambarde, Hugo Proenca

In this paper, we provide a detailed overview of the models used for information retrieval in the first and second stages of the typical

processing chain. We discuss the current state-of-the-art models, including methods based on terms, semantic retrieval, and neural.

Additionally, we delve into the key topics related to the learning process of these models. This way, this survey offers a comprehensive

understanding of the field and is of interest for for researchers and practitioners entering/working in the information retrieval domain.

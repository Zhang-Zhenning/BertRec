DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION USING MULTINOMIAL

NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER

Document classification is a classical machine learning problem. If there is a set of documents that is already

categorized/labeled in existing categories, the task is to automatically categorize a new document into one of the

existing categories. In this blog, I will elaborate upon the machine learning technique to do this.

We have an existing set of documents (D1-D5) that are categorized into Auto, Sports, and Computer.

Now the task is to categorize the new D6 and D7 into Auto, Sports, or Computer.

In machine learning, the given set of documents used to train the probabilistic model is called the training set.

The problem can be solved by the classification technique of machine learning. There are several machine learning

algorithms that can be tried out, including:

RandomForestClassifier

KNeighborsClassifier

PassiveAggressiveClassifier

Perceptron

RidgeClassifier

Feel free to try out these algorithms for yourself; I found Multinomial Naive Bayes to be one of the most effective

algorithms for this purpose.

In this blog, I will also provide an application of Multinomial Naive Bayes. I recommend going through the

following topics to build a strong foundation of this concept.

1. Conditional Probability

2. Bayes Theorem

3. Naive Bayes Classifier

4. Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier

Applying Multinomial Bayes Classification

Step 1

Calculate prior probabilities. These are the probability of a document being in a specific category from the given

set of documents.

P(Category) = (No. of documents classified into the category) divided by (Total number of documents)

P(Auto) = (No of documents classified into Auto)divided by (Total number of documents) = /  = 0.4

P(Sports) = /  = 0.4

P(Computer) = /  = 0.2

Step 2

Calculate Likelihood. Likelihood is the conditional probability of a word occurring in a document given that the

document belongs to a particular category.

P(Word/Category) = (Number of occurrence of the word in all the documents from a category+1) divided by (All the

words in every document from a category + Total number of unique words in all the documents)

P(Saturn/Auto) = (Number of occurrence of the word “SATURN” in all the documents in “AUTO”+1) divided by (All

the words in every document from “AUTO” + Total number of unique words in all the documents)

= (1+1)/(6+13) = 2/19 = 0.105263158

The tables below provide conditional probabilities for each word in Auto, Sports, and Computer.

Step 3

Calculate P(Category/Document) = P(Category) * P(Word1/Category) * P(Word2/Category) * P(Word3/Category)

P(Auto/D6) = P(Auto) * P(Engine/Auto) * P(Noises/Auto) * P(Car/Auto)

= (0.4) * (0.052631579) * (0.157894737)

= (0.00005831754)

P(Sports/D6) = 0.000174953

P(Computers/D6) = 0.00004882813

The most probable category for D6 to fall into is Sports, because it has the highest probability among its peers.

P(Auto/D7) = 0.00017495262

P(Sports/D7) = 0.0000583175

P(Computers/D7) = 0.00004882813

The most probable category for D7 to fall into is Auto, because it has the highest probability among its peers.

The Multinomial Naive Bayes technique is pretty effective for document classification.

Before concluding, I would recommend exploring following Python Packages, which provide great resources to

learn classification techniques along with the implementation of several classification algorithms.

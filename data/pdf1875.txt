In information retrieval, retrieving relevant passages, as opposed to whole documents, not only directly benefits the end user by

filtering out the irrelevant information within a long relevant document, but also improves retrieval accuracy in general. A critical

problem in passage retrieval is to extract coherent relevant passages accurately from a document, which we refer to as passage

extraction. While much work has been done on passage retrieval, the passage extraction problem has not been seriously studied.

Most existing work tends to rely on presegmenting documents into fixed-length passages which are unlikely optimal because the

length of a relevant passage is presumably highly sensitive to both the query and document.In this article, we present a new method

for accurately detecting coherent relevant passages of variable lengths using hidden Markov models (HMMs). The HMM-based method

naturally captures the topical boundaries between passages relevant and nonrelevant to the query. Pseudo-feedback mechanisms

can be naturally incorporated into such an HMM-based framework to improve parameter estimation. We show that with appropriate

parameter estimation, the HMM method outperforms a number of strong baseline methods on two datasets. We further show how the

HMM method can be applied on top of any basic passage extraction method to improve passage boundaries.

Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks

Nils Reimers, Iryna Gurevych

BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like

semantic textual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational

overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations (~65 hours) with

BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. 

In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network

structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for

finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. 

We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence

embeddings methods.

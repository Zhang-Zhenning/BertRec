A comparative study of methods for estimating query language models with pseudo feedback





We systematically compare five representative state-of-the-art methods for estimating query language models with pseudo feedback

in ad hoc information retrieval, including two variants of the relevance language model, two variants of the mixture feedback model,

and the divergence minimization estimation method. Our experiment results show that a variant of relevance model and a variant of

the mixture model tend to outperform other methods. We further propose several heuristics that are intuitively related to the good

retrieval performance of an estimation method, and show that the variations in how these heuristics are implemented in different

methods provide a good explanation of many empirical observations.

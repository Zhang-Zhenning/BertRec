Deep contextualized word representations for detecting sarcasm and irony

Suzana IliÄ‡, Edison Marrese-Taylor, Jorge A. Balazs, Yutaka Matsuo

Predicting context-dependent and non-literal utterances like sarcastic and ironic expressions still remains a challenging task in NLP, as it goes

beyond linguistic patterns, encompassing common sense and shared knowledge as crucial components. To capture complex morpho-

syntactic features that can usually serve as indicators for irony or sarcasm across dynamic contexts, we propose a model that uses character-

level vector representations of words, based on ELMo. We test our model on 7 different datasets derived from 3 different data sources,

providing state-of-the-art performance in 6 of them, and otherwise offering competitive results.

A Simple Topic Model (Mixture of Unigrams)

Sun 22 July 2012

This is an extended version of the appendix to my paper exploring trends in German Studies in the US between 1928 and

2006. In that paper I used a topic model (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). This tutorial is intended to help readers in the

humanities and social sciences start to understand how LDA works. It is, however, an extremely poor substitute for an

introductory class in Bayesian statistics.

Topic models typically start with two banal assumptions. The first is that in a large collection of texts there exist a number of

groups (or sources) of texts. In the case of academic journal articles, these groups might be associated with different journals,

authors, research subfields, or publication periods (e.g., the 1950s and 1980s). The second assumption is that texts from

different sources tend to use different vocabulary. If we are presented with an article selected from one of two different

academic journals, one dealing with literature and another with archeology, and we are told only that the word “plot” appears

frequently in the article, we would be wise to guess the article comes from the literary studies journal.

A major obstacle to understanding the remaining details about how topic models work is that their description relies on the

abstract language of probability. Existing introductions to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) tend to be pitched either at an

audience already fluent in statistics or at an audience with minimal background.  This being the case, I want to address an

audience that has some background in probability and statistics, perhaps at the level of the introductory texts of Hoff (2009),

Lee (2004), or Kruschke (2010).

Mixture of Unigrams

Before starting, I must make clear these are not the details of LDA. Instead, I will cover a close relative, what has been called

the mixture of unigrams. Understanding this model makes understanding the details of LDA easier. And the mixture of

unigrams model shares enough of the essential features of LDA that I feel comfortable calling it a topic model. (Its principal

shortcoming vis-à-vis LDA is that it does not model very well the polysemy pervasive in human language.)

To keep things concrete, I will consider a corpus of twenty academic journal articles drawn from a larger collection German

Studies journal articles. To keep things simple, I will pretend these articles make use of a vocabulary of only eight words. (The

articles have been selected so that, were their titles known, they would fall easily into two groups.) The corpus is given below. I

will show how a probabilistic model of the texts, starting from the assumption that there are a fixed number of groups, can infer

(1) which documents belong to which group and (2) what words are most strongly associated with each group.

Let us assume that there are two groups (\(K=2\)). We know that there are twenty articles (\(N=20\)) and that each article

consists of \(n_i\) words (\(n_1 = 11, n_2 = 17, \ldots, n_{20} = 28\)) drawn from a vocabulary of eight unique words (\(V=8\)).

Before considering the word frequencies in the corpus, we first specify our prior beliefs in keeping with the ideas outlined in

the opening paragraph. There are three assumptions to consider. First, if we knew which group (or topic) a document came

from, then we would anticipate that words from that document are those likely to be found in other documents associated with

the group. Second, since we do not have any information about the documents in advance, we will say that it is equally likely

that a document comes from topic one or topic two. Finally, since we have no information about what vocabulary is associated

with what topic, we will say that each word is equally likely to appear in documents associated with either topic. We can write

this with symbols as

$$\begin{aligned} w_{ij}|z_i &amp;\overset{i.i.d.} \sim Multinomial(1,\phi_{z_i}) \, j=1,\ldots, n_i \\\\ z_{1:N} &amp;\overset{ind}{\sim}

Multinomial(1, \theta) \\\\ \theta &amp;\sim Dirichlet(\alpha_{1:K}) \\\\ \phi_{1:K} &amp;\overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} Dirichlet(\beta_{1:V})\\\\

\end{aligned}$$

where \(w_{ij}\) is the \(j\)th word of document \(i\). \(z_i\) indicates the topic that document \(i\) is associated with (here either 1

or 2). \(\alpha_{1:K} = (1, 1)\) and \(\beta_{1:V} = (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)\) are the parameters for the two Dirichlet distributions which

express the prior beliefs described. (Note that \(Dirichlet(1,1)\) is equivalent to a \(Beta(1,1)\) distribution). The following table

gives a summary of notation,

$$\begin{aligned} w_{ij} &amp; \text{jth word of document i}\\\\ z_i &amp; \text{topic of document i} \\\\ n_i &amp; \text{number of words in

document i} \\\\ \alpha &amp; \text{parameter for document-topic Dirichlet} \\\\ \beta &amp; \text{parameter for topic-word Dirichlet} \\\\ N

&amp; \text{number of documents} \\\\ V &amp; \text{number of unique words (vocabulary)} \\\\ \end{aligned}$$

How should our beliefs change once we see the articles’ words? There are three inferential “moves” that, when combined,

move us towards an answer. Making each move in succession will eventually yield an updated representation of our beliefs.

These moves are easy to explain in English and the details only require familiarity with the Multinomial distribution and its

conjugate prior, the Dirichlet distribution—the pair being the multivariate analog of the Binomial distribution and its conjugate

prior, the Beta distribution. The first inferential move begins with an assumption. We assume that we know which documents

are associated with which topics and update our beliefs about how words are associated with each topic. (Remarkably, it will

not matter what topic assignments we start with.) Imagine that we have guessed the following topic assignments: the first ten

articles are from topic one, the remaining ten are from topic two, \(z = (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2)\). Now, if these

really were the true topic assignments, how would we adjust our beliefs about topic one? Glancing at the table, I can say at

least that the word “literary” should be more strongly associated with topic two than with topic one since it occurs in all of the

ten articles (100%) assigned to topic two whereas it occurs in only four of ten articles (30%) assigned to topic one. In symbols,

this reads

$$\begin{aligned} p(\phi_{1:K}|z_{1:N},w) &amp;\propto p(w|\phi_{1:K},z_{1:N}) p(\phi_{1:K})\\\\ &amp;=\prod_{i=1}^N \prod_{j=1}^{n_i}

Multinomial(w_{ij}|\phi_{z_i}) \times \prod_{k=1}^K Dirichlet(\phi_k|\beta_{1:V}) \\\\ &amp;\propto \prod_{i=1}^N \prod_{v=1}^V

\phi_{z_i,v}^{f_{i,v}} \times \prod_{k=1}^K \prod_{v=1}^V \phi_{k,v}^{\beta_v - 1}\\\\ &amp;=\prod_{k=1}^K \prod_{v=1}^V

\phi_{k,v}^{e_{k,v}} \times \prod_{k=1}^K \prod_{v=1}^V \phi_{k,v}^{\beta_v - 1}\\\\ &amp;=\prod_{k=1}^K \prod_{v=1}^V

\phi_{k,v}^{\beta_v + e_{k,v} - 1} \\\\ p(\phi_{1:K}|z_{1:N},w) &amp;= \prod_{k=1}^K Dirichlet(\phi_k|\beta_1 + e_{k,1}, \ldots, \beta_V


+ e_{k,V}) \\\\ \end{aligned}$$

where \(f_{i,v}\) is the number of times word \(v\) appears in document \(i\) and \(e_{k,v}\) is the number of times word \(v\) is

assigned to topic \(k\) across all documents.

The second move swaps the position of our ignorance. Now we guess which documents are associated with which topics,

making the assumption that we know both the makeup of each topic distribution and the overall prevalence of topics in the

corpus. If we continue with our example from the previous paragraph, in which we had guessed that “literary” was more strongly

associated with topic two than topic one, we would likely guess that the seventh article, with ten occurrences of the word

“literary”, is probably associated with topic two rather than topic one (of course we will consider all the words, not just “literary”).

This would change our topic assignment vector to \(z = (1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2)\). We take each article in turn

and guess a new topic assignment (in many cases it will keep its existing assignment). In symbols, this step reads

$$\begin{aligned} p(z_i=k|w,\phi_{1:K},\theta) &amp;\propto p(w|z_i=k,\phi_{1:K}) p(z_i=k|\theta) \\\\ &amp;\propto \lbrace

\prod_{j=1}^{n_i} p(w_{ij}|z_i=k,\phi_{1:K}) \rbrace p(z_i=k|\theta) \\\\ &amp;= \lbrace \prod_{v=1}^V \phi_{k,v}^{f_{i,v}} \rbrace

\theta_k \\\\ p(z_i|w,\phi_{1:K},\theta) &amp;= Multinomial(z_i|1,q^{(i)}) \\\\ \end{aligned}$$

where \(q^{(i)} \propto (\theta_1 \prod_{v=1}^V \phi_1^{f_{i,v}}, \ldots \theta_K \prod_{v=1}^V \phi_K^{f_{i,v}})\). So, considering

all the assignments,

$$\begin{aligned} p(z|w,\phi_{1:K},\theta) &amp;= \prod_{i=1}^{N} Multinomial(z_i|1,q^{(i)}) \\\\ \end{aligned}$$

Finally, we update our guess about the overall prevalence of topics in the corpus—are 80% of articles topic one or are 20%—

assuming that we know the topic assignments (which we have just guessed). The reasoning here is straightforward: if 80% of

the articles are assigned to topic one and 20% to topic two, then the true proportions are likely in the vicinity of 80% and 20%.

In symbols,

$$\begin{aligned} p(\theta|z_{1:N}) &amp;\propto p(z_{1:N}|\theta) p(\theta) \\\\ &amp;=\prod_{i=1}^N p(z_i|\theta) \prod_{k=1}^K

Dirichlet(\theta_k|\alpha) \\\\ &amp;\propto \prod_{k=1}^K \theta_k^{d_k} \prod_{k=1}^K \theta_k^{\alpha-1} \\\\ &amp;= \prod_{k=1}^K

\theta_k^{\alpha + d_k - 1} \\\\ p(\theta|z_{1:N}) &amp;= \prod_{k=1}^K Dirichlet(\theta_k|\alpha_1+d_1, \ldots, \alpha_K+d_K)\\\\

\end{aligned}$$

where \(d_k\) equals the number of documents assigned to topic \(k\).

Making these moves in succession over and over again is an instance of Gibbs sampling and eventually the topic

assignments and the specification of each topic multinomial distribution will converge to a representation reflecting what, given

our prior beliefs and the articles’ word frequencies, our updated beliefs ought to be.  And even if we had never encountered

Gibbs sampling before, it is clear that making these inferential moves in succession leads to more plausible topic

assignments (i.e. those documents containing “literary” end up in their own category). In this case, after 500 iterations (ignoring

the first 100), I have the following assignments, on average:

Starting only with the assumption that there were two topics and the two simple beliefs laid out in the opening paragraph, this

topic model recovers two distinct groups of documents and their characteristic words.


How many topics?

Assuming that there were two groups of articles made the inference above considerably easier. What if we are uncertain

about the number of topics? One model incorporating this uncertainty is a Dirichlet process mixture model. Just as the (finite)

mixture of unigrams model leads into LDA, the Dirichlet process mixture model is one way to approach the non-parametric

variant of LDA, which makes use of the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (Teh et al. 2006).

With a Dirichlet process mixture each observation gets its own parameter. Contrast this with the model above where each

observation was associated with one of \(K\) topics. The clustering property of the Dirichlet process means that many of the

parameters will be the same; we will end up with a small number of distinct parameters. In symbols the model reads,

$$\begin{aligned} w_{ij}|\phi_i &amp;\overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} Multinomial(1,\phi_i) (\text{for}\, j = 1, \ldots, n_i) \\\\ \phi_i &amp;\sim G\\\\ G

&amp;\sim DP(\alpha G_0)\\\\ G_0 &amp;\sim Dirichlet(\beta_{1:V})\\\\ \end{aligned}$$

(More comprehensive introduces to Dirichlet Process mixtures include Ranganathan (2006), Yu (2009)). In order to use Gibbs

sampling, all we need is the conditional representation of the DP. In symbols,

$$\begin{aligned} p(\phi_i|\phi_{-i}) = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha+N-1} G_0(\phi_i) + \frac{1}{\alpha+N-1} \sum_{j \ne i} \delta_{\phi_j}

(\phi_i) \\\\ \end{aligned}$$

This is all we need to write down the posterior for \(\phi_i\) given everything else,

$$\begin{aligned} p(\phi_i|w,\phi_{-i}) &amp;\propto p(w|\phi) p(\phi_i|\phi_{-i})\\\\ &amp;\propto p(w_{i\cdot}|\phi_i) p(\phi_i|\phi_{-i})\\\\ &amp;=

\prod_{v=1}^{V} \phi_{i,v}^{f_{i,v}} \lbrace \frac{\alpha}{\alpha+N-1} G_0(\phi_i) + \frac{1}{\alpha+N-1} \sum_{j \ne i}

\delta_{\phi_j}(\phi_i) \rbrace \\\\ &amp;= \frac{\alpha}{\alpha+N-1} G_0(\phi_i)\prod_{v=1}^{V} \phi_{i,v}^{f_{i,v}} + \frac{1}{\alpha+N-

1} \sum_{j \ne i} \delta_{\phi_j}(\phi_i) \prod_{v=1}^{V} \phi_{j,v}^{f_{i,v}} \\\\ p(\phi_i|w,\phi_{-i}) &amp;= q_{i0} p(\phi_i|w_{i\cdot}) +

\sum_{j \ne i} q_{ij} \delta_{\phi_j}(\phi_i) \\\\ \end{aligned}$$

where \(f_{i,v}\) is the number of times word \(v\) appears in document \(i\) and \(w_{i\cdot}\) is shorthand for \(w_{i1}, \ldots,

w_{in_j}\). \(p(\phi_i|w_{i\cdot})\) is the familiar posterior distribution, \(\frac{p(w_{i\cdot}|\phi_i)G_0(\phi_i)}{\int

p(w_{i\cdot}|\phi)G_0(\phi) d\phi}\), which we get by multiplying by a carefully selected value equal to one, i.e. \(\frac{\int

p(w_{i\cdot}|\phi)G_0(\phi) d\phi}{\int p(w_{i\cdot}|\phi)G_0(\phi) d\phi}\). And the remaining values are

$$\begin{aligned} q_{i0} &amp;= c \alpha \int p(w_{i\cdot}|\phi)G_0(\phi) d\phi = c \alpha \int \prod_{v=1}{V} \phi_v^{f_{i,v}}

\frac{\Gamma(\beta_1 + \ldots + \beta_V)}{\prod \Gamma(\beta_v)} \prod_{v=1}{V} \phi_v^{\beta_v-1} d\phi \\\\ &amp;= c \alpha

\frac{\Gamma(\beta_1 + \ldots + \beta_V)}{\prod \Gamma(\beta_v)} \frac{\prod \Gamma(\beta_v + f_{i,v})}{\Gamma(\beta_1 +

\ldots + \beta_V + n_i)}\\\\ q_{ij} &amp;= c \prod_{v=1}^{V} \phi_{j,v}^{f_{i,v}} \, , j\ne i\\\\ \end{aligned}$$

where \(c\) is a value that guarantees \(\sum_{j\ne i} q_{ij}\) equals one. The posterior is a mixture of distributions we know how

to sample from. The case is similar to sampling from a 20%-80% mixture of two normal distributions: first select which

distribution to sample from, with probability .2 and .8 respectively, and then draw from the appropriate distribution. Here we

select an index with probability proportional to \((q_{i0}, q_{i1}, q_{i{(i-1)}}, q_{i{(i+1)}}, q_{iN})\). If we draw an index of \(0\) we

sample from the prior \(G_0\) to obtain the parameter \(\phi_i\), otherwise we set \(\phi_i = \phi_j\), where \(j\) was the index

drawn (better sampling schemes are available, see Neal (2000) and Yu (2009)).

After 3,000 iterations, the most frequent number of clusters is three. The first six articles fall into their own group and the two

remaining clusters are spread over the remaining fourteen articles.

1. Both these assumptions are inaccurate. Each article in a collection is different and every book in a library is unique—

even books that are “copies” in the sense of being the same edition or from the same printing are visibly different under

a microscope (although usually one need not go that far). There are no shared “sources” of texts. And every printed word

is similarly unique, often visibly so if different fonts have been used; this challenges the idea of a fixed vocabulary. At their

best, models are useful fictions. �

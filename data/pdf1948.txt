Abstract

Dense retrieval aims at searching for the most relevant documents to the given query by encoding texts in the embedding

space, requiring a large amount of query-document pairs to train. Since manually constructing such training data is

challenging, recent work has proposed to generate synthetic queries from documents and use them to train a dense

retriever. However, compared to the manually composed queries, synthetic queries do not generally ask for implicit

information, therefore leading to a degraded retrieval performance. In this work, we propose Query Generation with

External Knowledge (QGEK), a novel method for generating queries with external information related to the

corresponding document. Specifically, we convert a query into a triplet-based template form to accommodate external

information and transmit it to a pre-trained language model (PLM). We validate QGEK on both in-domain and out-

domain dense retrieval settings. The dense retriever with the queries requiring implicit information is found to make

good performance improvement. Also, such queries are similar to manually composed queries, confirmed by both human

evaluation and unique &amp; non-unique words distribution.

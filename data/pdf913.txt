BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language

Understanding

Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova

We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly

conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional

output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without

substantial task-specific architecture modifications. 

BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks,

including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement),

SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute

improvement).

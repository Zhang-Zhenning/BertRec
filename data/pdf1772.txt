By the Bayesian Law of Large Numbers for iid data, the post-data measure concentrates on the distribution(s)

that minimize the L-divergence (aka the reverse I-divergence). Consequently, methods based on minimization

of other divergences are not consistent under misspecification, and in this sense ruled out. This point, which

has already been established analytically, is illustrated be means of a Monte Carlo study of the inconsistency

under misspecification of the Exponential Empirical Likelihood method that is based on the I-divergence

minimization.

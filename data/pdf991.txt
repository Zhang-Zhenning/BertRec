Novelty effect: How to ensure your research ideas are original and new

Novelty effect: How to ensure your research ideas are original and new

What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun.

— Ecclesiastes

Novelty can be described as the quality of being new, original or unusual

new, original or unusual. Novelty in scienti�c publishing is crucial,

because journal editors and peer reviewers greatly prize novel research over and above con�rmatory papers or research

with negative results. After all, why give precious and limited journal space to something previously reported when authors

submit novel, unreported discoveries?

How do you know what constitutes as novel? How can you as an academic author enhance the novelty effect with your

research submissions? Below we explore ideas that will help you maximise the novelty effect in your submissions.

a. New discovery

a. New discovery

This comprises research on and reports of completely new discoveries. These can be new chemical elements, planets or

other astrological phenomena, new species of �ora or fauna, previously undiagnosed diseases, viruses etc. These are

things never seen or reported before. Often such new discoveries serve as a seedbed for multiple reports or even

completely new avenues of research. Journals prize submissions on new discoveries

Journals prize submissions on new discoveries and often tout them in media

reports.

b. The exceptionally rare

b. The exceptionally rare

Not quite as exciting as new discoveries are reports on things not new, but seen or encountered exceptionally rarely, or not

for a long time. An example is the sighting of the rare pink hand�sh, recently spotted in Australia for the �rst time in

decades. In biomedical publishing, rare case reports of a near-unique condition (such as the separation of conjoined twins)

are occasionally published and make the nightly news.

c. New theories

c. New theories

Typically, these papers provide substantial data

substantial data which supports the novel thesis. Reports of new theories must have

rigorous logic

rigorous logic and need to stand on clear and well-documented foundations. They can’t be simple �ights of theoretical

fancy. As with new discoveries, new theories can spawn whole new branches of scienti�c inquiry.

d. New or signi�cantly improved diagnostic/laboratory techniques

d. New or signi�cantly improved diagnostic/laboratory techniques

Reports on novel techniques don’t usually receive coverage from the mass media, but can often garner huge numbers

can often garner huge numbers

of references

of references if the new technique is adopted by the scienti�c community. Publication-worthy techniques include those

which are more ef�cient, less time-consuming or more reliable than currently existing techniques or diagnostic procedures.

Anything that is truly new or improves signi�cantly on an established technique is potentially worthy of publication. In

medicine, new surgical techniques are very important, but here’s a tip

tip: try to provide a large prospective case series with

long-term follow-up instead of a just a single case report.

e. Existing data combined into new knowledge

e. Existing data combined into new knowledge

There is a profound novelty effect when researchers combine existing data/knowledge into something new. Ideas from

disparate, previously unrelated �elds of research can lead to completely novel discoveries with untold potential

applications. Translational or applied research

Translational or applied research (particularly in the biomedical sciences) has borne abundant fruit over

f. Incremental additions to the literature

Not all research or publications will report on truly novel discoveries; in fact, very few will. But that doesn’t necessarily

diminish the novelty effect of your work. The vast majority of published research

vast majority of published research adds incrementally to what is

already known, nudging scienti�c knowledge forward. The accumulation of incremental discovery leads, over time, to large

gains in understanding and knowledge.

How to ensure and verify the novelty effect

How to ensure and verify the novelty effect

Whether your research reports something completely new or furthers an existing �eld in a new way, you need to make sure

the contribution is indeed new.

Do your homework

Do your homework: Pore through the literature (in as many languages as possible) to make sure your idea is indeed

new, or signi�cantly different enough to be considered new.

To the degree possible, provide the ‘idea genealogy’ for your concept

To the degree possible, provide the ‘idea genealogy’ for your concept: Reference the major sources of those

who have come before you. Through references and by describing your thought processes, describe clearly how you

came up with the new idea or combination of ideas.

Disclose your sources of inspiration and new application

Disclose your sources of inspiration and new application: Doing so constitutes academic honesty, gives

credit to those upon whose shoulders your research rests and provides intellectual fertiliser for other scientists who

may, in turn, be able to build upon your own ideas.

All the best for your (novel) submission!

A Random Variable is a set of possible values from a random experiment.

Example: Tossing a coin: we could get Heads or Tails.

Let's give them the values Heads=0 and Tails=1 and we have a Random Variable "X":

 

0

1

X =

Random

Possible

Random

Variable

Values

Events

In short:

X = {0, 1}

Note: We could choose Heads=100 and Tails=150 or other values if we want! It is our choice.

So:

We have an experiment (such as tossing a coin)

We give values to each event

The set of values is a Random Variable

Not Like an Algebra Variable

In Algebra  a variable, like x, is an unknown value:

Example: x + 2 = 6

In this case we can find that x=4

But a Random Variable is different ...

A Random Variable has a whole set of values ...



















Advanced


















... and it could take on any of those values, randomly.

 

Example: X = {0, 1, 2, 3}

X could be 0, 1, 2, or 3 randomly.

And they might each have a different probability.

Capital Letters

We use a capital letter, like X or Y, to avoid confusion with the Algebra type of variable.

Sample Space

A Random Variable's set of values is the Sample Space.

Example: Throw a die once

Random Variable X = "The score shown on the top face".

X could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6

So the Sample Space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Probability

We can show the probability of any one value using this style:

P(X = value) = probability of that value

Example (continued): Throw a die once

X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

In this case they are all equally likely, so the probability of any one is 1/6

P(X = 1) = 1/6

P(X = 2) = 1/6

P(X = 3) = 1/6

P(X = 4) = 1/6

P(X = 5) = 1/6

P(X = 6) = 1/6

Note that the sum of the probabilities = 1, as it should be.

Example: How many heads when we toss 3 coins?


































X = "The number of Heads" is the Random Variable.

In this case, there could be 0 Heads (if all the coins land Tails up), 1

Head, 2 Heads or 3 Heads.

So the Sample Space = {0, 1, 2, 3}

But this time the outcomes are NOT all equally likely.

The three coins can land in eight possible ways:

 

 

X =   

"Number

of Heads"

Looking at the table we see just 1 case of Three Heads, but 3 cases of Two Heads, 3 cases of

One Head, and 1 case of Zero Heads. So:

P(X = 3) = 1/8

P(X = 2) = 3/8

P(X = 1) = 3/8

P(X = 0) = 1/8

 

Example: Two dice are tossed.

The Random Variable is X = "The sum of the scores on the two

dice".

Let's make a table of all possible values:

There are 6 × 6 = 36 possible outcomes, and the Sample Space (which is the sum of the

scores on the two dice) is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}

Let's count how often each value occurs, and work out the probabilities:

2 occurs just once, so P(X = 2) = 1/36

3 occurs twice, so P(X = 3) = 2/36 = 1/18

4 occurs three times, so P(X = 4) = 3/36 = 1/12

5 occurs four times, so P(X = 5) = 4/36 = 1/9

6 occurs five times, so P(X = 6) = 5/36

7 occurs six times, so P(X = 7) = 6/36 = 1/6

8 occurs five times, so P(X = 8) = 5/36

9 occurs four times, so P(X = 9) = 4/36 = 1/9

10 occurs three times, so P(X = 10) = 3/36 = 1/12

11 occurs twice, so P(X = 11) = 2/36 = 1/18

12 occurs just once, so P(X = 12) = 1/36

A Range of Values

We could also calculate the probability that a Random Variable takes on a range of values.

Example (continued) What is the probability that the sum of the scores is 5, 6,

7 or 8?

In other words: What is P(5 ≤ X ≤ 8)?

P(5 ≤ X ≤ 8) = P(X=5) + P(X=6) + P(X=7) + P(X=8)

= (4+5+6+5)/36

= 20/36

= 5/9

Solving

We can also solve a Random Variable equation.

Example (continued) If P(X=x) = 1/12, what is the value of x?


Looking through the list above we find:

P(X=4) = 1/12, and

P(X=10) = 1/12

So there are two solutions: x = 4 or x = 10

Notice the different uses of X and x:

X is the Random Variable "The sum of the scores on the two dice".

x is a value that X can take.

Continuous

Random Variables can be either Discrete or Continuous :

Discrete Data can only take certain values (such as 1,2,3,4,5)

Continuous Data can take any value within a range (such as a person's height)

All our examples have been Discrete.

Summary

A Random Variable is a set of possible values from a random experiment.

The set of possible values is called the Sample Space.

A Random Variable is given a capital letter, such as X or Z.

Random Variables can be discrete or continuous.

Multinoulli distribution

Multinoulli distribution

by Marco Taboga, PhD

The Multinoulli distribution (sometimes also called categorical distribution) is a multivariate discrete

distribution that generalizes the Bernoulli distribution.



How the distribution is used

How the distribution is used

If you perform an experiment that can have only two outcomes (either success or failure), then a

random variable that takes value 1 in case of success and value 0 in case of failure is a Bernoulli

random variable.

If you perform an experiment that can have 



 outcomes and you denote by 



 a random variable

that takes value 1 if you obtain the 



-th outcome and 0 otherwise, then the random vector 



 defined

as



is a Multinoulli random vector.

In other words, when the 



-th outcome is obtained, the 



-th entry of the Multinoulli random vector 



takes value 



, while all the other entries are equal to 



.

In what follows the probabilities of the 



 possible outcomes will be denoted by 



.

The distribution is characterized as follows.

 strictly positive numbers such that




We say that

 if its joint probability mass

If you are puzzled by the above definition of the joint pmf, note that when 



 and 



because the 



-th outcome has been obtained, then all other entries are equal to

A sum of independent Multinoulli random variables is a multinomial random variable. This is

discussed and proved in the lecture entitled Multinomial distribution.

Large language models like GPT-3 have stormed the NLP area in the last few years and have given us hope that we

can solve some of the toughest problems.

The race to build the best language model has resulted in a so-called ‘arms race’ where bigger seems to be better so

far.

 by Open AI is the most well-known and most anticipated among other popular language models. It has been

trained with 175 billion parameters. Many applications have been built with GPT-3 to demonstrate its capabilities,

more for fun than profit.

But it does show the path forward in NLP and democratizes applications that build with NLP at the core. For NLP to

come to the forefront in everyday applications, zero-shot learning, and few-shot learning is the way forward.

The recent news about 

, a code completion and code recommendation tool from Github, has spotlighted

generative language models and their capabilities. Copilot could be the first commercial use of such models in a big

way.

Others are not staying behind. Microsoft has built 

, a 17 billion parameter model already used in 

’s

search engine to improve auto-suggestion and phrase prediction. This is a well-known commercial application of

generative language models.

Even though this model is 10X downscaled compared to GPT-3, the fact that Microsoft has found it to be useful

enough to use in a search engine demonstrates the capabilities for such models.

 had made an announcement of 1.6 trillion parameter language model early this year. This has been built by

the Google Brain team using an efficient transformer based algorithm called Switch Transformers. 

This gives the hope that the cost to train and use such huge language models can be brought down making them

economically feasible for small and medium companies working in the NLP area. This should give a huge boost to

building more applications based on generative models.

Although application of this 1.6T language model has not been published as yet, Google has claimed in the past of

using 

 based transformer models in Google search engine. 

So, it is very likely that this will find its way into Google’s search engine in the near future.

Google’s 

 chabot model is yet another application of a large language model which has been trained in

conversation data. This is a 2.6 billion parameter model and was trained in multi-turn conversations which is one of

the most difficult tasks for a chatbot.

The latest development in this area is the news about a 1.75 trillion parameters language model, called 

,

built by Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence that understands English and Chinese and is claimed to simulate

conversations, understand pictures, write poems and even create recipes.

The future of Generative Language Models

Currently, Open AI is pursuing 

 of GPT-3. One good example of this is 

 which has built a

product to find answers to user queries buried deep in customer surveys, product reviews and help desk data.

 uses DocuSense Technology to provide easy access to relevant information. The engine parses

Information Retrieval as Card Playing: A Formal Model for Optimizing Interactive Retrieval Interface





We propose a novel formal model for optimizing interactive information retrieval interfaces. To model interactive retrieval in a general

way, we frame the task of an interactive retrieval system as to choose a sequence of interface cards to present to the user. At each

interaction lap, the system's goal is to choose an interface card that can maximize the expected gain of relevant information for the

user while minimizing the effort of the user with consideration of the user's action model and any desired constraints on the interface

card. We show that such a formal interface card model can not only cover the Probability Ranking Principle for Interactive Information

Retrieval as a special case by making multiple simplification assumptions, but also be used to derive a novel formal interface model

for adaptively optimizing navigational interfaces in a retrieval system. Experimental results show that the proposed model is effective in

automatically generating adaptive navigational interfaces, which outperform the baseline pre-designed static interfaces.

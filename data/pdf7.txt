Dependency-based Mixture Language Models

Zhixian Yang, Xiaojun Wan

Various models have been proposed to incorporate knowledge of syntactic structures into neural language models. However, previous works

have relied heavily on elaborate components for a specific language model, usually recurrent neural network (RNN), which makes themselves

unwieldy in practice to fit into other neural language models, such as Transformer and GPT-2. In this paper, we introduce the Dependency-

based Mixture Language Models. In detail, we first train neural language models with a novel dependency modeling objective to learn the

probability distribution of future dependent tokens given context. We then formulate the next-token probability by mixing the previous

dependency modeling probability distributions with self-attention. Extensive experiments and human evaluations show that our method can be

easily and effectively applied to different neural language models while improving neural text generation on various tasks.

Representing information variability

Quantity of information stands for the minimum number of words required to

describe any situation

Practical approach with the Huffman trees

Theoretical approach with Shannon’s entropy

Definition of entropy (image by author)

Why not consider the variance rather than examining Shannon’s entropy?

Variance requires speculation about the data


A “perfect” model can always be found (image by author)

Entropy does not require assumptions, at the cost of data discretization


Quantifying the mutual information between two variables

Information theory and set theory

Theoretical justification

Visualization of formulas

Joint entropy of two random variables (image by author)

Joint entropy inequalities (image by author)


Mutual information between two random variables (image by author)

The definition of mutual information

Normalized mutual information for two variables (image by author)

Bounds of the normalized mutual information (image by author)

The case of continuous variables

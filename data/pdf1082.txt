Natural language processing (NLP) is a technology that is already starting to shape the way we engage with the world. With the

help of complex algorithms and intelligent analysis, NLP tools can pave the way for digital assistants, chatbots, voice search, and

dozens of applications we’ve scarcely imagined. 

Of course, NLP isn’t on an unlimited upward trajectory just yet. There are still many issues faced by NLP developers—but we’re

already starting to find ways to resolve them. 

What Is Natural Language Processing? 

Let’s start with the basics. NLP exists at the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). Essentially,

NLP systems attempt to analyze, and in many cases, “understand” human language. These systems are often responsible for

recognizing human speech (in other words, being able to “hear” what someone is saying), understanding human speech (in other

words, figuring out the context of what they’re saying), and generating natural language (in other words, talking back). 

If you’ve had a conversation with a digital assistant or chatbot recently, you’ve likely seen firsthand just how far we’ve come in

terms of technological sophistication. However, we still have a long way to go. 

The Biggest Issues of NLP

If we’re going to keep progressing in terms of the potential applications and overall capabilities of NLP, these are some of the most

important issues we need to resolve: 

1. Language differences.

Language differences. In the United States, most people speak English, but if you’re thinking of reaching an international

and/or multicultural audience, you’ll need to provide support for multiple languages. Different languages have not only vastly

different sets of vocabulary, but also different types of phrasing, different modes of inflection, and different cultural

expectations. You can resolve this issue with the help of “universal” models that can transfer at least some learning to other

languages. However, you’ll still need to spend time retraining your NLP system for each new language. 

2. Training data.

Training data. At its core, NLP is all about analyzing language to better understand it. A human being must be immersed in a

language constantly for a period of years to become fluent in it; even the best AI must also spend a significant amount of time

reading, listening to, and utilizing a language. The abilities of an NLP system depend on the training data provided to it. If you

feed the system bad or questionable data, it’s going to learn the wrong things, or learn in an inefficient way. 

3. Development time.

Development time. Along similar lines, you also need to think about the development time for an NLP system. To be

sufficiently trained, an AI must typically review millions of data points; processing all those data can take lifetimes if you’re using

an insufficiently powered PC. However, with a distributed deep learning model and multiple GPUs working in coordination,

you can trim down that training time to just a few hours. Of course, you’ll also need to factor in time to develop the product

from scratch—unless you’re using NLP tools that already exist. 

4. Phrasing ambiguities.

Phrasing ambiguities. Sometimes, it’s hard even for another human being to parse out what someone means when they say

something ambiguous. There may not be a clear, concise meaning to be found in a strict analysis of their words. In order to

resolve this, an NLP system must be able to seek context that can help it understand the phrasing. It may also need to ask the

user for clarity. 

5. Misspellings.

Misspellings. Misspellings are a simple problem for human beings; we can easily associate a misspelled word with its properly

spelled counterpart, and seamlessly understand the rest of the sentence in which it’s used. But for a machine, misspellings can

be harder to identify. You’ll need to use an NLP tool with capabilities to recognize common misspellings of words, and move

beyond them. 

6. Innate biases.

Innate biases. In some cases, NLP tools can carry the biases of their programmers, as well as biases within the data sets used

to train them. Depending on the application, an NLP could exploit and/or reinforce certain societal biases, or may provide a

better experience to certain types of users over others. It’s challenging to make a system that works equally well in all

situations, with all people. 

7. Words with multiple meanings.

Words with multiple meanings. No language is perfect, and most languages have words that could have multiple meanings,

depending on the context. For example, a user who asks, “how are you” has a totally different goal than a user who asks

something like “how do I add a new credit card?” Good NLP tools should be able to differentiate between these phrases with

the help of context. 

8. Phrases with multiple intentions.

Phrases with multiple intentions. Some phrases and questions actually have multiple intentions, so your NLP system can’t

oversimplify the situation by interpreting only one of those intentions. For example, a user may prompt your chatbot with

something like, “I need to cancel my previous order and update my card on file.” Your AI needs to be able to distinguish these

intentions separately. 

9. False positives and uncertainty.

False positives and uncertainty. A false positive occurs when an NLP notices a phrase that should be understandable

and/or addressable, but cannot be sufficiently answered. The solution here is to develop an NLP system that can recognize its

own limitations, and use questions or prompts to clear up the ambiguity. 

10. Keeping a conversation moving.

Keeping a conversation moving. Many modern NLP applications are built on dialogue between a human and a machine.

Accordingly, your NLP AI needs to be able to keep the conversation moving, providing additional questions to collect more

information and always pointing toward a solution.

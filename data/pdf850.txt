Optimization

Optimization is concerned with the analysis and algorithmic aspects of maximizing or minimizing an objective function subject to constraints, often in

complex problems in high dimension. Active research areas in ORFE include interior-point methods, the parametric simplex method, stochastic

optimization, and convex analysis. Applications of interest span from portfolio optimization to engineering applications such as optimal control,

optical design, and machine learning.

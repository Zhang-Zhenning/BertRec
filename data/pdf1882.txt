Revisiting the Divergence Minimization Feedback Model





Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) has proven to be an effective strategy for improving retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we revisit a

PRF method based on statistical language models, namely the divergence minimization model (DMM). DMM not only has apparently

sound theoretical foundation, but also has been shown to satisfy most of the retrieval constraints. However, it turns out to perform

surprisingly poorly in many previous experiments. We investigate the cause, and reveal that DMM inappropriately tackles the entropy

of the feedback model, which generates highly skewed feedback model. To address this problem, we propose a maximum-entropy

divergence minimization model (MEDMM) by introducing an entropy term to regularize DMM. Our experiments on various TREC

collections demonstrate that MEDMM not only works much better than DMM, but also outperforms several other state of the art PRF

methods, especially on web collections. Moreover, unlike existing PRF models that have to be combined with the original query to

perform well, MEDMM can work effectively even without being combined with the original query.

Abstract

In this article, we study a generalization of the two-groups model in the presence of covariates—a problem that has

recently received much attention in the statistical literature due to its applicability in multiple hypotheses testing

problems. The model we consider allows for infinite dimensional parameters and offers flexibility in modeling the

dependence of the response on the covariates. We discuss the identifiability issues arising in this model and

systematically study several estimation strategies. We propose a tuning parameter-free nonparametric maximum

likelihood method, implementable via the expectation-maximization algorithm, to estimate the unknown

parameters. Further, we derive the rate of convergence of the proposed estimators—in particular we show that the

finite sample Hellinger risk for every ‘approximate’ nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator achieves a near-

parametric rate (up to logarithmic multiplicative factors). In addition, we propose and theoretically study two

‘marginal’ methods that are more scalable and easily implementable. We demonstrate the efficacy of our

procedures through extensive simulation studies and relevant data analyses—one arising from neuroscience and

the other from astronomy. We also outline the application of our methods to multiple testing. The companion R

package NPMLEmix implements all the procedures proposed in this article.

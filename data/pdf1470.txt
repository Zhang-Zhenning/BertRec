Dirichlet distribution

Dirichlet distribution

by Marco Taboga, PhD

The Dirichlet distribution is a multivariate continuous probability distribution often used to model

the uncertainty about a vector of unknown probabilities.



Generalizing the Beta distribution

Generalizing the Beta distribution

The Dirichlet distribution is a multivariate generalization of the Beta distribution.

Denote by 



 the probability of an event. If 



 is unknown, we can treat it as a random variable, and

assign a Beta distribution to 



.

If 



 is a vector of unknown probabilities of mutually exclusive events, we can treat 



 as a random

vector and assign a Dirichlet distribution to it.

Definition

Definition

The Dirichlet distribution is characterized as follows.

Definition  Let 



 be a 



 continuous random vector. Let its support be



Let 



. We say that 



 has a Dirichlet distribution with parameters 



 if and only

if its joint probability density function is



where the normalizing constant 



 is



and 



 is the Gamma function.


Caveat

Caveat

In the above definition, the entries of the vector 



 are 



 probabilities 



 whose sum is less

than or equal to 1:



If we want to have a vector of probabilities exactly summing up to 1, we can define an additional

probability



so that



However, there is no way to rigorously define a probability density for the vector



because the constraint in equation (2) implies that the probability density should be zero everywhere

on 



 except on a subset whose Lebesgue measure is equal to zero, and on the latter set the

probability density should be infinite (something involving a Dirac delta function).

Therefore, the right way to deal with 



 events whose probabilities sum up to 1 is to:

assign a Dirichlet density, as defined above, to the probabilities of 



 events (



).

define the probability 



 of the 



-th event as in equation (1).

We notice that several sources (including the Wikipedia page on the Dirichlet distribution) are not

entirely clear about this point.

How the distribution is derived

How the distribution is derived

How do we come up with the above formula for the density of the Dirichlet distribution?

The next proposition provides some insights.

Proposition  Let 



 be independent Gamma random variables having means 



 and

degrees-of-freedom parameters 



. Define



Then, the 



 random vector




has a Dirichlet distribution with parameters 



.

Proof

Relation to the Beta distribution

Relation to the Beta distribution

The Beta distribution is a special case of the Dirichlet distribution.

If we set the dimension 



 in the definition above, the support becomes



and the probability density function becomes



By using the definition of the Beta function



we can re-write the density as



But this is the density of a Beta random variable with parameters 



 and 



.

Marginal distributions

Marginal distributions

The following proposition is often used to prove interesting results about the Dirichlet distribution.

Proposition  Let 



 be a 



 Dirichlet random vector with parameters 



. Let 



 be any

integer such that 



. Then, the the marginal distribution of the 



 subvector



is a Dirichlet distribution with parameters 



.

Proof

A corollary of the previous two propositions follows.

Proposition  Let 



 be a 



 Dirichlet random vector with parameters 



. Then, the marginal

distribution of the 



-th entry of

 and

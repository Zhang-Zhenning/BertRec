Unique Value of Text Data

• Useful to all big data applications

• Especially useful for mining knowledge about people’s behavior, 

attitude, and opinions

• Directly express knowledge about our world: Small text data are 

also useful!

However, NLP is difficult!

Answer:  Having humans in the loop! 

How can we leverage imperfect NLP to 

build a perfect general application?

A Probabilistic Model for ADR Extraction [Wang et al. 14] 

• Challenge: how do we separate treated symptoms from side-effect 

symptoms? 

• Solution: leverage knowledge about known symptoms of diseases 

treated by a drug

• Probabilistic model

– Assume forum posts are generated from a mixture language model

– Most words are generated using a background language model

– Treated (disease) symptoms and side-effect symptoms are generated from 

separate models, enabled by the use of external knowledge about known 

disease symptoms

– Fitting the model to the forum data allows us to learn the side-effect symptom 

distributions

Excellent location in walking 

distance to Tiananmen Square and 

shopping streets. That’s the best 

part of this hotel! The rooms are 

getting really old. Bathroom was 

nasty. The fixtures were falling off, 

lots of cracks and everything 

looked dirty. I don’t think it worth 

the price. Service was the most 

disappointing part, especially the 

door men. this is not how you treat 

guests, this is not hospitality.

Major Challenges in Building a General TextScope

• Different applications have different requirements è Need abstraction

– What are the common analysis operators shared by multiple text analysis tasks? 

– How can we design a general text analysis language covering many applications? 

• Retrieval and analysis need to be integrated è A unified operator-based framework

– How can we formalize retrieval and analysis functions as multiple compatible general 

operators?  

– How can we manage workflow? 

• How can we optimize human-computer collaboration? 

– How can TextScope adapt to a user’s need dynamically and support personalization?

– How can humans train/teach TextScope with minimum effort? 

• How can we perform joint analysis of text and non-text data? 

• Implementation Challenges: Architecture of a general TextScope? Real-time response?

Summary

• Human as Subject Intelligent Sensor è Special value of text for mining

– Applicable to all “big data” applications 

– Especially useful for mining human behavior, preferences, and opinions

– Directly express knowledge (small text data are useful as well)

• Difficulty in NLP è Must optimize the collaboration of humans and machines, 

maximization of combined intelligence of humans and computers

– Let computers do what they are good at (statistical analysis and learning) 

– Turn imperfect techniques into perfect applications 

• Vision of TextScope:  many applications &amp; many new challenges

– Integration of intelligent retrieval and text analysis 

– Joint analysis of text and non-textual (context) data

– How to optimize the collaboration (combined intelligence) of computer and humans?

General Open Research Challenges

• Grand Challenge: How to maximize the combined intelligence of humans and machines 

instead of intelligence of machines alone

• How to optimize the “cooperative game” of human-computer collaboration?

– Machine learning is just one way of human-computer collaboration

– What are other forms of collaboration? How to optimally divide the task between humans and 

machines?

• How to minimize the total effort of a user in finishing a task?

– How to go beyond component evaluation to measure task-level performance? 

– How to optimize sequential decision making (reinforcement learning)?

– How to model/predict user behavior? 

– How to minimize user effort in labeling data (active learning)? 

– How to explain system operations to users?

• How to minimize the total system operation cost? 

– How to model and predict system  operation cost (computing resources, energy consumption, etc)? 

– How to optimize the tradeoff between operation cost and system intelligence?

• Robustness Challenge: How to manage/mitigate risk of system errors? Security problems?

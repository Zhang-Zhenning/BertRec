Natural language processing (NLP) has come a long way over the past few years. With the

development of powerful new models such as GPT-3 and BERT

GPT-3 and BERT, it's now possible to create

sophisticated applications that can understand and interact with human language.

However, what went viral as a disruptive chatbot with ChatGPT, suddenly became a contest of

language models to power AI content. So, we decided to oppose GPT-3 vs. BERT

GPT-3 vs. BERT to understand

their differences and similarities, explore their capabilities, and discuss some of the tools that use

them.

What is GPT-3?

What is GPT-3?

GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is an autoregressive language model developed by

OpenAI

OpenAI. It was trained on a dataset of 45TB of text data from sources such as Wikipedia, books,

and webpages. The model is capable of generating human-like text when given a prompt. It can

also be used for tasks such as question answering, summarization, translation, and more.

Several AI content writing tools currently use GPT-3, such as:

ChibiAI

WriteSonic

What is BERT?

What is BERT?

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is another popular language

model developed by Google AI

Google AI. Unlike GPT-3, BERT is a bidirectional transformer model, which

considers both left and right context when making predictions. This makes it better suited for

sentiment analysis or natural language understanding (NLU) tasks.

Differences between GPT-3 and BERT

Differences between GPT-3 and BERT

The most obvious difference between GPT-3 and BERT

difference between GPT-3 and BERT is their architecture. As mentioned

above, GPT-3 is an autoregressive model, while BERT is bidirectional. While GPT-3 only considers

the left context when making predictions, BERT takes into account both left and right context. This

makes BERT better suited for tasks such as sentiment analysis or NLU, where understanding the

full context of a sentence or phrase is essential.

Another difference between the two models lies in their training datasets. While both models

were trained on large datasets of text data from sources like Wikipedia and books, GPT-3 was

trained on 45TB of data, while BERT was trained on 3TB of data. So, GPT-3 has access to more

information than BERT, which could give it an edge in specific tasks such as summarization or

translation, where access to more data can be beneficial.

Finally, there are differences in terms of size as well. While both models are very large (GPT-3 has

1.5 billion parameters while BERT has 340 million parameters), GPT-3 is significantly larger than its

predecessor due to its much more extensive training dataset size (470 times bigger than the one

used to train BERT).

Similarities between GPT-3 and BERT

Similarities between GPT-3 and BERT

Despite their differences in architecture and training datasets size, there are also some

similarities between GPT-3 and BERT

similarities between GPT-3 and BERT:

They use the Transformer architecture to learn context from textual-based datasets using

attention mechanisms.

They are unsupervised learning models (they don’t require labeled data for training).

They can perform various NLP tasks such as question answering, summarization, or translation

with varying degrees of accuracy, depending on the task.

GPT-3 vs. BERT: capabilities comparison

Both GPT-3 and BERT

GPT-3 and BERT have been shown to perform well on various NLP tasks, including question

answering, summarization, or translation, with varying degrees of accuracy depending on the task

at hand.

However, due to its larger training dataset size, GPT-3 tends to outperform its predecessor in

certain tasks, such as summarization or translation, where having access to more data can be

beneficial. 

On other tasks, such as sentiment analysis or NLU, BERT tends to do better due to its bidirectional

nature, which allows it to take into account both left and right context when making predictions. In

contrast, GPT -3 only considers left context when predicting words or phrases in a sentence.

Conclusion

Conclusion

The bottom line is that GPT-3 and BERT have proven themselves valuable tools for performing

various NLP tasks with varying degrees of accuracy. However, due to their differences in

architecture and training dataset size, each model is better suited for certain tasks than others.

For example, GPT-3 is better suited for summarization or translation, while BERT is more

beneficial for sentiment analysis or NLU. Ultimately, the choice between the two models will

depend on your specific needs and which task you are looking to accomplish.

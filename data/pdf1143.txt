What is a Distribution

What is an event?

Back to KL divergence

Problem we’re trying to solve

x teeth / total number of worms

Intuition: KL divergence is a way of measuring the

matching between two distributions (e.g. threads)

Let’s change a few things in the example


First try: Model this with a uniform distribution

Second try: Model this with a binomial distribution

Let’s summarize what we have

How do we quantitatively decide which ones the best?

Intuitive breakdown of the KL divergence

log(p(x_i)/q(x_i))

q(x_i)

p(x_i)

q(x_i)

p(x_i)

p(x_i)=q(x_i)

p(x_i)

p(x_i)

p(x_i)

log(0)

Model Document Generator

You can use the Model Document Generator to create documentation associated with any trained model. It

will generate a Microsoft Word™ .docx file that provide information regarding:

What the model does

How the model was built (algorithms, features, processing, …)

How the model was tuned

What are the model’s performances

It allows you to prove that you followed industry best practices to build your model.

Generate a model document

 Note

To use this feature, the graphical export library must be activated on your DSS instance. Please check with

your administrator.

Once a model has been trained, you can generate a document from it with the following steps:

Go to the trained model you wish to document (either a model trained in a Visual Analysis of the Lab or a

version of a saved model deployed in the Flow)

Click the Actions  button on the top-right corner

Select Export model documentation

On the modal dialog, select the default template or upload your own template, and click Export  to

generate the document

After the document is generated, you will be able to download your generated model document using the

Download  link

 Warning

Any placeholders starting with the keyword design  will be linked to the current status of your visual

analysis. If you change parameters in your model, DSS will consider that placeholder values are outdated

and will replace these placeholders with blanks in the generated documentation. If you delete your visual

analysis and then generate a document from a saved model, any placeholders starting with the keyword

design  will not provide any result.

Custom templates

If you want the document generator to use your own template, you need to use Microsoft Word™ to create a



.docx  file.

You can create your base document as you would create a normal Word document, and add placeholders

when you want to retrieve information from your model.

Sample templates

Instead of starting from scratch, you can modify the default templates:

 Download the default template for prediction here

 Download the default template for clustering here

Placeholders

A placeholder is defined by a placeholder name inside two brackets, like {{design.prediction_type.name}} . The

generator will read the placeholder and replace it with the value retrieved from the model.

There are multiples types of placeholders, which can produce text, an image, or a table.







You can format the style of a table placeholder by using a block placeholder and placing an empty table inside

it.




Conditional placeholders

If you want to build a single template able to handle several kinds of models, you may need to display

information only when they are relevant. For example, you may want to describe what is a binary

classification, but this description should only appear on your binary classification models. This can be

achieved with a conditional placeholder.

A conditional placeholder contains three elements, each of them needs to be on a separate line:

a condition

a text to display if the condition is valid

a closing element

Example:

{{if design.prediction_type.name == Binary classification}}

The model {{design.prediction_type.name}} is a binary classification.

{{endif design.prediction_type.name}}

{{if design.prediction_type.name != Binary classification}}

The model {{design.prediction_type.name}} is a not binary classification.

{{endif design.prediction_type.name}}

The condition itself is composed of three parts:

a text placeholder

an operator ( ==  or != )

a reference value

Example:

{{if my.placeholder == myReferenceValue }}

During document generation, the placeholder is replaced by its value and compared to the reference value. If

the condition is correct, the text is displayed, otherwise nothing will appear on the final document.

Limitations

You need to upgrade the table of contents manually after a document generation

The Model Document Generator is currently not compatible with ensemble models

The Model Document Generator is currently not compatible with Keras nor computer vision models

The Model Document Generator is currently not compatible with models imported from MLflow

The Model Document Generator is not compatible with plugin algorithms

When generating a document from a visual analysis, the model document generator will not display

outdated design information. To fix this issue, you can either run a new analysis or revert the design to

match the analysis

When generating a document from a saved model version, some information may be extracted from the

original Visual Analysis Design settings. As a result, any placeholders starting with design  will be empty

when the Visual Analysis was modified or erased

Each part of a conditional placeholder must necessarily be in a new line

Table and conditional placeholders are not supported on headers and footers

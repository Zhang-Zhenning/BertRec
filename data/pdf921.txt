A Sequential Decision Formulation of the Interface Card Model for Interactive IR





The Interface Card model is a promising new theoretical framework for modeling and optimizing interactive retrieval interfaces, but

how to systematically instantiate it to solve concrete interface optimization problems remains an open challenge. We propose a novel

formulation of the Interface Card model based on sequential decision theory, leading to a general framework for formal modeling of

user states and stopping actions. The proposed framework naturally connects optimization of interactive retrieval with Markov

Decision Processes and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, and enables the use of reinforcement learning algorithms

for optimizing interactive retrieval interfaces. Simulation and user study experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

model in automatically adjusting the interface layout in adaptation to inferred user stopping tendencies in addition to user interaction

and screen size.

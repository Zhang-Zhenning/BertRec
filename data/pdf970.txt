Cognitive Perspectives of Information Retrieval Interaction:

Elements of a Cognitive IR Theory

P. Ingwersen  • Published 1996  • Computer Science  • J. Documentation

The objective of the paper is to amalgamate theories of text retrieval from various research traditions into a cognitive theory for information retrieval

interaction. Set in a cognitive framework, the paper outlines the concept of polyrepresentation applied to both the user's cognitive space and the information

space of IR systems. The concept seeks to represent the current user's information need, problem state, and domain work task or interest in a structure of

causality. Further, it implies… Expand

Y. Xu, Chengliang Liu  • Computer Science  • J. Assoc. Inf. Sci. Technol.  • 2007

 A comprehensive framework is proposed in Part I (Y. Xu, 2007) of this report to describe interactive information retrieval

(IIR) behavior and a set of propositions are proposed to describe the mechanisms governing users' cognitive activity and the

interaction between users' Cognitive states and manifested retrieval behavior.

A subjective logic formalisation of the principle of polyrepresentation for information needs

A subjective logic formalisation of the principle of polyrepresentation for information needs

C. Lioma, Birger Larsen, Hinrich Schütze, P. Ingwersen  • Computer Science  • IIiX  • 2010

 This paper applies Subjective Logic to model different representations of information needs as beliefs marked by

degrees of uncertainty, and combines such beliefs using different logical operators, and discusses these combinations with

respect to different retrieval scenarios and situations.

New directions in cognitive information retrieval

New directions in cognitive information retrieval

Birger Larsen, P. Ingwersen  • Psychology  • 2005

 The principle of polyrepresentation provides a holistic and explicitly cognitive framework for understanding the

processes involved in Information Retrieval (IR) and can be applied simultaneously to the cognitive space of the user – thus

integrating the two perspectives into one coherent cognitive framework.

P. Ingwersen, S. Copenhagen, K. Järvelin  • Psychology  • 2007

 The paper demonstrates how the Laboratory Research Framework fits into the holistic Cognitive Framework for IR by

outlining how interactive IR is viewed from a Cognitive Framework, and ' light' interactive IR experiments are suggested

performed by drawing on the latter framework' s contextual possibilities.

P. Ingwersen  • Computer Science  • SIGIR '94  • 1994

 The paper outlines the principles underlying the theory of polyrepresentation and suggests to represent the current user’s

information need, problem state, and domain work task or interest in a structure of causality as well as to embody semantic

full-text entities by means of the principle of 'intentional redundancy'.

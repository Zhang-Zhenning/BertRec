Beyond Probability Ranking Principle: Modeling the Dependencies among Documents





Probability Ranking Principle (PRP), which assumes that each document has a unique and independent probability to satisfy a

particular information need, is one of the fundamental principles for ranking. Traditionally, heuristic ranking features and well-known

learning-to-rank approaches have been designed by following the PRP principle. Recently, neural IR models, which adopt deep

learning to enhance the ranking performances, also obey the PRP principle. Though it has been widely used for nearly five decades,

in-depth analysis shows that PRP is not an optimal principle for ranking, due to its independent assumption that each document

should be independent of the rest candidates. Counter examples include pseudo relevance feedback, interactive information retrieval,

search result diversification, etc. To solve the problem, researchers recently proposed to model the dependencies among the

documents during the designing of ranking models. A number of ranking models have been proposed and state-of-the-art ranking

performances have been achieved. This tutorial aims to give a comprehensive survey on these recently developed ranking models

that go beyond the PRP principle. The tutorial tries to categorize these models based on their intrinsic assumptions: assuming that the

documents are independent, sequentially dependent, or globally dependent. In this way, we expect the researchers focusing on

ranking in search and recommendation can have a novel angle of view on the designing of ranking models, and therefore can

stimulate new ideas on developing novel ranking models. The material of this tutorial can be found in

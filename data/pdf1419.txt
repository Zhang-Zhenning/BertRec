Definition

A language model assigns a probability to a piece of unseen text, based on some training data. For example, a language model based on a big

English newspaper archive is expected to assign a higher probability to “a bit of text” than to “aw pit tov tags,” because the words in the former

phrase (or word pairs or word triples if so-called N-Gram Models are used) occur more frequently in the data than the words in the latter phrase.

For information retrieval, typical usage is to build a language model for each document. At search time, the top ranked document is the one whose

language model assigns the highest probability to the query.

Historical Background

The term language models originates from probabilistic models of language generation developed for automatic speech recognition systems in the

early 1980s [9]. Speech recognition systems use a language model to complement the results of the acoustic modelwhich models the relation

between words (or...

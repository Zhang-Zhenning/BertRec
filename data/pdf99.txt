Abstract:

Text mining is the task of automatic discovery of new, previously unknown information from unstructured

document collections. Vector space or bag of words representation is one of the mainstream descriptions

of text, in which each document is a data point in high-dimensional space and order between words is

omitted. Generative models are probabilistic representation of data that can be regarded as the generator

of observed data. Being probabilistic modelling approaches, a set of methods and criterions are available

for model estimation, inference, comparison and selection for generative models. In this paper, we review

several existing probabilistic models that are commonly applied to discrete exchangeable collections in

English text. We hope this will shed some light on the Chinese text modelling and mining tasks.

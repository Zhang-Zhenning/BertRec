Details in proof for convergence of Expectation Maximization Algorithm

I am going through the paper provided here http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dgovinda/pdf/recog/EM_algorithm-1.pdf

I could not make out how the following was derived

∑zP(z|X,θn)ln(

P(X|z,θ)P(z|θ)

P(z|X,θn)

)−lnP(X|θn)

=∑zP(z|X,θn)ln(

P(X|z,θ)P(z|θ)

P(z|X,θn)P(X|θn))

Considering that the left summation in first equation has several terms how is lnP(X|θn) distributed over it?

I think there might be a typo if you check with formula (10)

i think we need to apply distribution before Jensen's inequality

Isn't that simply that

∑

z P(z|X,θn) =1

and hence that

∑

zP(z|X,θn)ln

P(X|z,θ)P(z|θ)

P(z|X,θn)

−lnP(X|θn)

=

∑

z

P(z|X,θn)ln

P(X|z,θ)P(z|θ)

P(z|X,θn)

−

∑

z

P(z|X,θn)lnP(X|θn)

=

∑

z

P(z|X,θn)ln

P(X|z,θ)P(z|θ)

P(z|X,θn)P(X|θn)

Would be useful to add that this works because ln P(X|theta_n) doesn't have z and can be put outside of sum

Not really.....

Then how the sum is same as without it? Could you elaborate?

I believe it is due to the law of total probability

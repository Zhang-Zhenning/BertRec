LDA- Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Every document is a probability distribution of topics and every topic is a probability

distribution of words. In another way, a document is a mixture of topics and a topic is a

mixture of words.

Words like- is, am, are, has, have, etc you have to remove as they don't carry information.

Before you start finding the topics, you must decide how many topics you want. This is

basically represented as K.

All topics except for the words you currently have can be considered.

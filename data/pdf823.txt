Understanding the Behaviors of BERT in Ranking

Yifan Qiao, Chenyan Xiong, Zhenghao Liu, Zhiyuan Liu

This paper studies the performances and behaviors of BERT in ranking tasks. We explore several different ways to leverage the pre-trained

BERT and fine-tune it on two ranking tasks: MS MARCO passage reranking and TREC Web Track ad hoc document ranking. Experimental

results on MS MARCO demonstrate the strong effectiveness of BERT in question-answering focused passage ranking tasks, as well as the

fact that BERT is a strong interaction-based seq2seq matching model. Experimental results on TREC show the gaps between the BERT pre-

trained on surrounding contexts and the needs of ad hoc document ranking. Analyses illustrate how BERT allocates its attentions between

query-document tokens in its Transformer layers, how it prefers semantic matches between paraphrase tokens, and how that differs with the

soft match patterns learned by a click-trained neural ranker.

Comments: There is an error in Table 1 and we will update them to correct results. Please refer to MS MARCO Leaderboard for the actually evaluation results

Interactive Information Retrieval: Models, Algorithms, and

Evaluation

Chengxiang Zhai  • Published 25 July 2020  • Computer Science  • 

Proceedings of the 43rd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval

Since Information Retrieval (IR) is an interactive process in general, it is important to study Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR), where we would attempt to

model and optimize an entire interactive retrieval process (rather than a single query) with consideration of many different ways a user can potentially

interact with a search engine. This tutorial systematically reviews the progress of research in IIR with an emphasis on the most recent progress in the

development of models… Expand

Interactive Information Retrieval with Bandit Feedback

Interactive Information Retrieval with Bandit Feedback

Huazheng Wang, Yiling Jia, Hongning Wang  • Computer Science  • SIGIR  • 2021

 This tutorial covers the online policy learning solutions for interactive IR with bandit feedback and addresses the new

challenges that arose in such a solution paradigm, including sample complexity, costly and even outdated feedback, and

ethical considerations in online learning (such as fairness and privacy) in interactive IR.

Towards a game-theoretic framework for text data retrieval

Towards a game-theoretic framework for text data retrieval

ChengXiang Zhai  • Computer Science  • IEEE Data Eng. Bull.  • 2016

 A new game-theoretic formulation of the text data retrieval problem is presented where the key idea is to model text

retrieval as a process of a search engine and a user playing a cooperative game, with a shared goal of satisfying the user's

information need while minimizing the user’s effort and the operation cost of the retrieval system.

Dynamic Test Collections for Retrieval Evaluation

Dynamic Test Collections for Retrieval Evaluation

Ben Carterette, Ashraf Bah Rabiou, M. Zengin  • Computer Science  • ICTIR  • 2015

 This work proposes dynamic test collections, a dynamic test collection that consists of a set of topics and relevance

judgments and generates queries in response to the system, which can be used for evaluating retrieval systems that make use

of session history or other user information to try to improve results.

 A novel formulation of the Interface Card model based on sequential decision theory is proposed, leading to a general

framework for formal modeling of user states and stopping actions, and enables the use of reinforcement learning algorithms

for optimizing interactive retrieval interfaces.

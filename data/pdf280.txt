Topic Modeling

Why Topic Modeling?

extracting topics from documents

Applications of Topic Modeling:

Before we start, here is a basic assumption:

document

mixture of topics

topic

mixture of words






topic

mixture of words

Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Latent Semantic Analysis

Breaking down documents into topics and words

Steps:

ⱼ

 Truncated Singular Value Decomposition 

top-k topics, 

 X = Uₖ * Sₖ * Vₖ.

Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis

Limitations:

Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Bayesian version of pLSA

Graphical representation of LDA

Assumption

Steps

Implementation of LDA in python


from sklearn.datasets import

from pprint import

Data pre-processing


text-preprocessing


text2bow

Running LDA

specify the

number of topics

Visualizing the topics:


# Seems to be Computer and Technology

 # Seems to be Science and Technology

# seems to be politics

# seems to be sports

# seems to be religion

Evaluating LDA

Perplexity 






Coherence

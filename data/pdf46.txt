Abstract

This paper describes an approach for constructing a mixture of language models based on simple statistical

notions of semantics using probabilistic models developed for information retrieval. The approach encapsulates

corpus-derived semantic information and is able to model varying styles of text. Using such information, the

corpus texts are clustered in an unsupervised manner and a mixture of topic-speci�c language models is

automatically created. The principal contribution of this work is to characterise the document space resulting from

information retrieval techniques and to demonstrate the approach for mixture language modelling. A comparison

is made between manual and automatic clustering in order to elucidate how the global content information is

expressed in the space. We also compare (in terms of association with manual clustering and language modelling

accuracy) alternative term-weighting schemes and the e�ect of singular value decomposition dimension

reduction (latent semantic analysis). Test set perplexity results using the British National Corpus indicate that the

approach can improve the potential of statistical language modelling. Using an adaptive procedure, the

conventional model may be tuned to track text data with a slight increase in computational cost.

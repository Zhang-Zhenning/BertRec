Three basic problems of HMMs

Once we have an HMM, there are three problems of interest.

(1)The Evaluation Problem

Given an HMM 



 and a sequence of observations 



 , what is the probability that the observations are generated by

the model, 



 ?

(2)The Decoding Problem

Given a model 



 and a sequence of observations 



 , what is the most likely state sequence in the model that produced

the observations?

(3)The Learning Problem

Given a model 



 and a sequence of observations 



 , how should we adjust the model parameters 



 in order

to maximize 



Evaluation problem can be used for isolated (word) recognition. Decoding problem is related to the continuous recognition as well as to the

segmentation. Learning problem must be solved, if we want to train an HMM for the subsequent use of recognition tasks.

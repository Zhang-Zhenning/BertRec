A Survey on Information Retrieval, Text Categorization, and Web Crawling

Youssef Bassil

This paper is a survey discussing Information Retrieval concepts, methods, and applications. It goes deep into the document and query

modelling involved in IR systems, in addition to pre-processing operations such as removing stop words and searching by synonym

techniques. The paper also tackles text categorization along with its application in neural networks and machine learning. Finally, the

architecture of web crawlers is to be discussed shedding the light on how internet spiders index web documents and how they allow users to

search for items on the web.

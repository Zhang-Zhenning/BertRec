Estimation of α

Lower bounds for α

Estimating of Fs and its density fs

Mixture model with two components



F(x) = αFs(x) + (1 − α)Fb(x)

(1)



Fb is a known distribution function (DF).



Unknowns: mixing proportion α ∈ (0, 1) and DF Fs (̸= Fb).



Problem: Given a random sample from X1, X2, . . . , Xn

ind.

∼ F, we

wish to (nonparametrically) estimate Fs and the parameter α.

Previous work





Most of the previous work on this problem assume some constraint

(parametric models) on the form of Fs; see e.g., Lindsay (AoS, 1983),

Lindsay and Basak (JASA, 1993).



Bordes et al. (AoS, 2006) assume that both the components belong to an

unknown symmetric location-shift family.



In the multiple testing setup, this problem has been addressed mostly to

estimate α under suitable assumptions; see e.g., Storey (JRSSB, 2002),

Genevese &amp; Wasserman (AoS, 2004), Meinshausen &amp; Rice (AoS, 2006).

Applications





In multiple testing problems, e.g., microarray analysis, neuroimaging

(fMRI).



Any situation where numerous independent hypotheses tests are

performed.



The p-values are uniformly distributed on [0,1], under H0, while their

distribution associated with H1 is unknown; see e.g., Efron (2010).



Estimate the proportion of false null hypotheses α; also needed to

control multiple error rates, such as the FDR of Benjamini &amp;

Hochberg (JRSSB, 1995).



In contamination problems – application in astronomy.

An application in astronomy





We analyse the radial velocity (RV; line of sight velocity)

distribution of stars in Carina, a dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy.



The data have been obtained by Magellan and MMT telescopes and

consist of radial velocity measurements for n = 1215 stars from

Carina, contaminated with Milky Way stars in the ﬁeld of view.



We would like to understand the distribution of the line of sight

velocity of stars in Carina.



For the contaminating stars from the Milky Way in the ﬁeld of view,

we assume a non-Gaussian velocity distribution Fb that is known

from the Besancon Milky Way model (Robin et. al, 2003),

calculated along the line of sight to Carina.



Here α is the proportion of stars from Carina.

We observe an i.i.d. sample from F = αFs + (1 − α)Fb.



A naive estimator of Fs would be

,

where Fn is the empirical DF of the observed sample.

s,n is not a valid DF: need not be non-decreasing or lie in [0, 1].

The above optimization problem is the same as minimizing

∥V − θ∥2 over θ = (θ1, . . . , θn) ∈ Θinc

where Θinc = {θ ∈ Rn : 0 ≤ θ1 ≤ θ2 ≤ . . . ≤ θn ≤ 1},

V = (V1, V2, . . . , Vn), Vi := ˆF α

s,n(X(i)), i = 1, 2, . . . , n.



The estimator ˆθ is uniquely deﬁned by the projection theorem; it is

the L2 projection of V on a closed convex cone in Rn.



Can easily be computed using the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm

(PAVA); see Section 1.2 of Robertson et al. (1988).

Identiﬁability





When α is unknown, the problem is non-identiﬁable.



If F = αFs + (1 − α)Fb for some Fb (known) and α (unknown),

then the mixture model can be re-written as

F = (α + γ)

�

α

α + γ Fs +

γ

α + γ Fb

�

+ (1 − α − γ)Fb,

for 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1 − α, and the term (αFs + γFb)/(α + γ) can be

thought of as the nonparametric component.



A trivial solution occurs when we take α + γ = 1, in which case

ˇF 1

s,n = ˆF 1

s,n = Fn.



Hence, α is not uniquely deﬁned.


Estimation of α

Identiﬁability





We redeﬁne the mixing proportion as

α0 := inf

�

γ ∈ (0, 1) : F − (1 − γ)Fb

γ

is a valid DF

�

.



Intuitively, this deﬁnition makes sure that the “signal” distribution Fs

does not include any contribution from the known “background” Fb.



We consider the estimation of α0 as deﬁned above.

Lemma



Suppose that Fs and Fb are absolutely continuous, i.e., they have

densities fs and fb, respectively. Then α0 &lt; α iﬀ there exists c &gt; 0 such

that fs(x) ≥ cfb(x), for all x ∈ R.



If the support of Fs is strictly contained in that of Fb, then the

problem is identiﬁable.


Estimation of α

Lower bounds for α

Estimating of Fs and its density fs

Estimation of α0





When γ = 1, ˆF γ

s,n = Fn = ˇF γ

s,n.



When γ is much smaller than α0, the regularization of ˆF γ

s,n modiﬁes

it, and thus ˆF γ

s,n and ˇF γ

s,n are quite diﬀerent.

Lower bound for α0



Construct a ﬁnite sample (honest) lower conﬁdence bound ˆαn with

the property

P(α0 ≥ ˆαn) ≥ 1 − β,

for all n,

(3)

for a speciﬁed conﬁdence level (1 − β), 0 &lt; β &lt; 1.



Would allow one to assert, with a speciﬁed level of conﬁdence, that

the proportion of “signal” is at least ˆαn.



It can also be used to test the hypothesis that there is no “signal” at

level β by rejecting when ˆαn &gt; 0.



Genovese &amp; Wasserman (AoS, 2004) and Meinshausen &amp; Rice (AoS,

2006) usually yield approximate conservative lower bounds.

Hn is distribution-free and can be easily simulated.



Requires no tuning parameters.



Lower bound holds for all n.



For moderately large n (e.g., n ≥ 500) the distribution Hn can be

very well approximated by that of the (square-root of) Cram´er-von

We wish to test n null hypothesis H01, H02, . . . , H0n using p-values

,

where V is the number of false rejections and R is the number of

The BH method guarantees FDR ≤ βα0; an estimate of α0 can be

used to yield a procedure with FDR approximately equal to β and

thus will result in an increased power.

Application to multiple testing





Our method can be used to yield an estimator of α0.



We can also obtain a completely nonparametric estimator of Fs, the

distribution of the p-values arising from the alternative hypotheses.



The local false discovery rate (LFDR) is deﬁned as the function

l : (0, 1) → [0, ∞), such where

l(x) = P(Hi = 0|Xi = x) = (1 − α0)fb(x)

f (x)

.



The LFDR method can help detect “interesting” cases (e.g.,

l(x) ≤ 0.20); see Section 5 of Efron (2010).



If fs is a assumed to have a non-increasing density, we have a natural

tuning-parameter-free estimator ˆl of the LFDR:

ˆl(x) =

(1−ˇαn)fb(x)

ˇαnf †

s,n(x)+(1−ˇαn)fb(x), for x ∈ (0, 1).

For the contaminating stars from the Milky Way in the ﬁeld of view,

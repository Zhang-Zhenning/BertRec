The query likelihood model is a language model[1][2] used in information retrieval. A language model is constructed for each

document in the collection. It is then possible to rank each document by the probability of specific documents given a query. This is

interpreted as being the likelihood of a document being relevant given a query.

Calculating the likelihood [edit]

Using Bayes' rule, the probability  of a document , given a query  can be written as follows:

Since the probability of the query 

 is the same for all documents, this can be ignored. Further, it is typical to assume that the

probability of documents is uniform. Thus, 

 is also ignored.

Documents are then ranked by the probability that a query is observed as a random sample from the document model. The multinomial

unigram language model is commonly used to achieve this. We have:

,where the multinomial coefficient is 

 for query ,

and 

 is the length of query  given the term frequencies  in the query vocabulary .

In practice the multinomial coefficient is usually removed from the calculation. The reason is that it is a constant for a given bag of

words (such as all the words from a specific document ). The language model 

 should be the true language model calculated from

the distribution of words underlying each retrieved document. In practice this language model is unknown, so it is usually approximated

by considering each term (unigram) from the retrieved document together with its probability of appearance. So 

 is the probability

of term  being generated by the language model 

 of document . This probability is multiplied for all terms from query  to get a rank

for document  in the interval 

. The calculation is repeated for all documents to create a ranking of all documents in the document

collection. [3]

Frequentists vs. Bayesians

Which are the best parameters/coefficients for my

model?

Setting Up Our Problem

β

β

β

prior

evidence

Probability and Likelihood

L


point-wise estimate

no prior distribution

Simpson’s Paradox


Back to Our Problem

p(y|β)

 L(β|y)

p(y_1,y_2,...,y_n|β)

L(β|y_1,y_2,...,y_n)

p(A,B) = p(A)p(B)

L(β|y1,y2,…,yn) = p(y1|β)p(y2|β),…,p(yn|β) = ∏p(yi|β)

Initial Cost Function

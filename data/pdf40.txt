A probabilistic mixture model for mining and analyzing product search log





The booming of e-commerce in recent years has led to the generation of large amounts of product search log data. Product search

log is a unique new data with much valuable information and knowledge about user preferences over product attributes that is often

hard to obtain from other sources. While regular search logs (e.g., Web search logs) contain click-throughs for unstructured text

documents (e.g., web pages), product search logs contain clickth-roughs for structured entities defined by a set of attributes and their

values. For instance, a laptop can be defined by its size, color, cpu, ram, etc. Such structures in product entities offer us opportunities

to mine and discover detailed useful knowledge about user preferences at the attribute level, but they also raise significant challenges

for mining due to the lack of attribute-level observations.

In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic mixture model for attribute-level analysis of product search logs. The model is based on

a generative process where queries are generated by a mixture of unigram language models defined by each attribute-value pair of a

clicked entity. The model can be efficiently estimated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The estimated parameters,

including the attribute-value language models and attribute-value preference models, can be directly used to improve product search

accuracy, or aggregated to reveal knowledge for understanding user intent and supporting business intelligence. Evaluation of the

proposed model on a commercial product search log shows that the model is effective for mining and analyzing product search logs

to discover various kinds of useful knowledge.

Proof of Lagrange Multipliers

Here we will give two arguments, one geometric and one analytic for why Lagrange multi­

pliers work. 

Critical points 

For the function w = f(x, y, z) constrained by g(x, y, z) = c (c a constant) the critical points 

are deﬁned as those points, which satisfy the constraint and where Vf is parallel to Vg. 

In equations: 

Vf(x, y, z) = λVg(x, y, z) and g(x, y, z) = c. 

Statement of Lagrange multipliers 

For the constrained system local maxima and minima (collectively extrema) occur at the 

critical points. 

Geometric proof for Lagrange 

(We only consider the two dimensional case, w = f(x, y) with constraint g(x, y) = c.)

For concreteness, we’ve drawn the constraint curve, g(x, y) = c, as a circle and some level

curves for w = f(x, y) = c with explicit (made up) values. Geometrically, we are looking

for the point on the circle where w takes its maximum or minimum values.

Now, start at the level curve with w = 17, which has no points on the circle. So, clearly, the 

maximum value of w on the constraint circle is less than 17. Move down the level curves 

until they ﬁrst touch the circle when w = 14. Call the point where the ﬁrst touch P . It is 

clear that P gives a local maximum for w on g = c, because if you move away from P in 

either direction on the circle you’ll be on a level curve with a smaller value. 

Since the circle is a level curve for g, we know Vg is perpendicular to it. We also know Vf 

is perpendicular to the level curve w = 14, since the curves themselves are tangent, these 

two gradients must be parallel. 

Likewise, if you keep moving down the level curves, the last one to touch the circle will give 

a local minimum and the same argument will apply.

Analytic proof for Lagrange (in three dimensions)

Suppose f has a local maximum at P on the constraint surface.

Let r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) be an arbitrary parametrized curve which lies on the constraint

surface and has (x(0), y(0), z(0)) = P . Finally, let h(t) = f(x(t), y(t), z(t)). The setup

guarantees that h(t) has a maximum at t = 0.

Taking a derivative using the chain rule in vector form gives

h'(t) = Vf|r(t) · r'(t). 

Since t = 0 is a local maximum, we have 

h'(0) = Vf|P · r'(0) = 0. 

Thus, Vf|P is perpendicular to any curve on the constraint surface through P. 

This implies Vf|P is perpendicular to the surface. Since Vg|P is also perpendicular to the 

surface we have proved Vf|P is parallel to Vg|P .

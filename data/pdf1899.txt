I am learning about pLSA (Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis) right now, in the hopes of being able to apply it to biomolecular annotation prediction.

I have a very simple question: How do you choose the number of topics / classes to use in the algorithm? I've searched also literature but I did not find anything enough useful.

The number of topics / latent classes can be considered as a "meta" parameter of the model which has to be tuned using resampling (e.g. cross-validation) such that it minimizes your loss/risk function while keeping the run time of

the algorithm reasonable.

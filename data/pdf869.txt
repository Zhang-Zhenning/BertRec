HOW TO WRITE AND PUBLISH A RESEARCH PAPER IN 7 STEPS

David Sleeman | 03.08.2021

What comes next after you're done with your research? Publishing the results in a journal of course! We tell you how to present your work in the best way possible.

This post is part of a series, which serves to provide hands-on information and resources for authors and editors.

Things have gotten busy in scholarly publishing: These days, a new article gets published in the 50,000 most important peer-reviewed journals every few seconds, while each one takes on average 40

minutes to read. Hundreds of thousands of papers reach the desks of editors and reviewers worldwide each year and 50% of all submissions end up rejected at some stage.

In a nutshell: there is a lot of competition, and the people who decide upon the fate of your manuscript are short on time and overworked. But there are ways to make their lives a little easier and improve

your own chances of getting your work published!

How so?

Well, it may seem obvious, but before submitting an academic paper, always make sure that it is an excellent re�ection of the research you have done and that you present it in the most professional way

possible. Incomplete or poorly presented manuscripts can create a great deal of frustration and annoyance for editors who probably won’t even bother wasting the time of the reviewers!

This post will discuss 7 steps to the successful publication of your research paper:

Check whether your research is publication-ready

Choose an article type

Choose a journal

Construct your paper

Decide the order of authors

Check and double-check

Submit your paper

1. CHECK WHETHER YOUR RESEARCH IS PUBLICATION-READY

Should you publish your research at all?

If your work holds academic value – of course – a well-written scholarly article could open doors to your research community. However, if you are not yet sure, whether your research is ready for

publication, here are some key questions to ask yourself depending on your �eld of expertise:

Have you done or found something new and interesting? Something unique?

Is the work directly related to a current hot topic?

Have you checked the latest results or research in the field?

Have you provided solutions to any difficult problems?

Have the findings been verified?

Have the appropriate controls been performed if required?

Are your findings comprehensive?

If the answers to all relevant questions are “yes”, you need to prepare a good, strong manuscript. Remember, a research paper is only useful if it is clearly understood, reproducible and if it is read and

used.

2. CHOOSE AN ARTICLE TYPE

The �rst step is to determine which type of paper is most appropriate for your work and what you want to achieve. The following list contains the most important, usually peer-reviewed article types in

the natural sciences:

Full original research papers disseminate completed research �ndings. On average this type of paper is 8-10 pages long, contains �ve �gures, and 25-30 references. Full original research papers are an

important part of the process when developing your career.

Review papers present a critical synthesis of a speci�c research topic. These papers are usually much longer than original papers and will contain numerous references. More often than not, they will be

commissioned by journal editors. Reviews present an excellent way to solidify your research career.

Letters, Rapid or Short Communications are often published for the quick and early communication of signi�cant and original advances. They are much shorter than full articles and usually limited in

length by the journal. Journals speci�cally dedicated to short communications or letters are also published in some �elds. In these the authors can present short preliminary �ndings before developing a

full-length paper.

3. CHOOSE A JOURNAL

Are you looking for the right place to publish your paper? Find out here whether a De Gruyter journal might be the right �t.

Submit to journals that you already read, that you have a good feel for. If you do so, you will have a better appreciation of both its culture and the requirements of the editors and reviewers.

Other factors to consider are:

The specific subject area

The aims and scope of the journal

The type of manuscript you have written

The significance of your work

The reputation of the journal

The reputation of the editors within the community

The editorial/review and production speeds of the journal

The community served by the journal

The coverage and distribution

The accessibility (open access vs. closed access)

4. CONSTRUCT YOUR PAPER

Each element of a paper has its purpose, so you should make these sections easy to index and search.

Don’t forget that requirements can di�er highly per publication, so always make sure to apply a journal’s speci�c instructions – or guide – for authors to your manuscript, even to the �rst draft (text

layout, paper citation, nomenclature, �gures and table, etc.) It will save you time, and the editor’s.

Also, even in these days of Internet-based publishing, space is still at a premium, so be as concise as possible. As a good journalist would say: “Never use three words when one will do!”

Let’s look at the typical structure of a full research paper, but bear in mind certain subject disciplines may have their own speci�c requirements so check the instructions for authors on the journal’s home

page.

4.1 THE TITLE

It’s important to use the title to tell the reader what your paper is all about! You want to attract their attention, a bit like a newspaper headline does. Be speci�c and to the point. Keep it informative and

concise, and avoid jargon and abbreviations (unless they are universally recognized like DNA, for example).

4.2 THE ABSTRACT

This could be termed as the “advertisement” for your article. Make it interesting and easily understood without the reader having to read the whole article. Be accurate and speci�c, and keep it as brief

and concise as possible. Some journals (particularly in the medical �elds) will ask you to structure the abstract in distinct, labeled sections, which makes it even more accessible.

A clear abstract will in�uence whether or not your work is considered and whether an editor should invest more time on it or send it for review.

4.3 KEYWORDS

Keywords are used by abstracting and indexing services, such as PubMed and Web of Science. They are the labels of your manuscript, which make it ‘searchable’ online by other researchers.

Include words or phrases (usually 4-8) that are closely related to your topic but not “too niche” for anyone to �nd them. Make sure to only use established abbreviations. Think about what scienti�c

terms and its variations your potential readers are likely to use and search for. You can also do a test run of your selected keywords in one of the common academic search engines. Do similar articles to

your own appear? Yes? Then that’s a good sign.

4.4 INTRODUCTION

This �rst part of the main text should introduce the problem, as well as any existing solutions you are aware of and the main limitations. Also, state what you hope to achieve with your research.

Do not confuse the introduction with the results, discussion or conclusion.

4.5 METHODS

Every research article should include a detailed Methods section (also referred to as “Materials and Methods”) to provide the reader with enough information to be able to judge whether the study is

valid and reproducible.

Include detailed information so that a knowledgeable reader can reproduce the experiment. However, use references and supplementary materials to indicate previously published procedures.

4.6 RESULTS

In this section, you will present the essential or primary results of your study. To display them in a comprehensible way, you should use subheadings as well as illustrations such as �gures, graphs, tables

and photos, as appropriate.

4.7 DISCUSSION

Here you should tell your readers what the results mean.

Do state how the results relate to the study’s aims and hypotheses and how the �ndings relate to those of other studies. Explain all possible interpretations of your �ndings and the study’s limitations.

Do not make “grand statements” that are not supported by the data. Also, do not introduce any new results or terms. Moreover, do not ignore work that con�icts or disagrees with your �ndings. Instead

…

Be brave! Address con�icting study results and convince the reader you are the one who is correct.

4.8 CONCLUSION

Your conclusion isn’t just a summary of what you’ve already written. It should take your paper one step further and answer any unresolved questions.

Sum up what you have shown in your study and indicate possible applications and extensions. The main question your conclusion should answer is: What do my results mean for the research �eld and my

community?

4.9 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND ETHICAL STATEMENTS

It is extremely important to acknowledge anyone who has helped you with your paper, including researchers who supplied materials or reagents (e.g. vectors or antibodies); and anyone who helped with

the writing or English, or o�ered critical comments about the content.

Remember to state why people have been acknowledged and ask their permission. Ensure that you acknowledge sources of funding, including any grant or reference numbers.

writing goals.

Furthermore, if you have worked with animals or humans, you need to include information about the ethical approval of your study and, if applicable, whether informed consent was given. Also, state

whether you have any competing interests regarding the study (e.g. because of �nancial or personal relationships.)

4.10 REFERENCES

The end is in sight, but don’t relax just yet!

De facto, there are often more mistakes in the references than in any other part of the manuscript. It is also one of the most annoying and time-consuming problems for editors.

Remember to cite the main scienti�c publications on which your work is based. But do not in�ate the manuscript with too many references. Avoid excessive – and especially unnecessary – self-citations.

Also, avoid excessive citations of publications from the same institute or region.

5. DECIDE THE ORDER OF AUTHORS

In the sciences, the most common way to order the names of the authors is by relative contribution.

Generally, the �rst author conducts and/or supervises the data analysis and the proper presentation and interpretation of the results. They put the paper together and usually submit the paper to the

journal.

Co-authors make intellectual contributions to the data analysis and contribute to data interpretation. They review each paper draft. All of them must be able to present the paper and its results, as well as

to defend the implications and discuss study limitations.

Do not leave out authors who should be included or add “gift authors”, i.e. authors who did not contribute signi�cantly.

6. CHECK AND DOUBLE-CHECK

As a �nal step before submission, ask colleagues to read your work and be constructively critical.

Make sure that the paper is appropriate for the journal – take a last look at their aims and scope. Check if all of the requirements in the instructions for authors are met.

Ensure that the cited literature is balanced. Are the aims, purpose and signi�cance of the results clear?

Conduct a �nal check for language, either by a native English speaker or an editing service.

7. SUBMIT YOUR PAPER

When you and your co-authors have double-, triple-, quadruple-checked the manuscript: submit it via e-mail or online submission system. Along with your manuscript, submit a cover letter, which

highlights the reasons why your paper would appeal to the journal and which ensures that you have received approval of all authors for submission.

It is up to the editors and the peer-reviewers now to provide you with their (ideally constructive and helpful) comments and feedback. Time to take a breather!

If the paper gets rejected, do not despair – it happens to literally everybody. If the journal suggests major or minor revisions, take the chance to provide a thorough response and make improvements as

you see �t. If the paper gets accepted, congrats!

It’s now time to get writing and share your hard work – good luck!

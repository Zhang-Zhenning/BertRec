Home &gt; Artiﬁcial Intelligence &gt; What is the EM Algorithm in Machine Learning? [Explained with Examples]

The EM algorithm or Expectation-Maximization algorithm is a latent variable model

that was proposed by Arthur Dempster, Nan Laird, and Donald Rubin in 1977.

In the applications for machine learning, there could be few relevant variables part of

the data sets that go unobserved during learning. Try to understand Expectation-

Maximization or the EM algorithm to gauge the estimation of all latent variables using

observed data. You might begin with understanding the main problems in this

context of EM algorithm variables.

In the context of statistic modeling, the most common problem could be when you try

estimating joint probability distribution for any data set in em algorithm in machine

learning.

Probability Density related estimation

Probability Density related estimation is actually the construction of estimate-

based as per the observed data. When you explain em algorithm in machine learning,

it involves selecting probability distribution functions as well as the parameters of this

function best explaining the joint probability of observed data.

 The initial step in density estimation relates to creating a plot of all observations in

a random sample. This is a basic part of understanding em algorithm in machine

learning.

In terms of the output, the bin number plays the most signiﬁcant role in how many

bars are available in distribution. It also determines how nicely density gets plotted.

Density estimation needs the selection of probability distribution-related functions

and parameters of distribution that explain the joint probability-related distribution of

a sample. The main problem with this density estimation could be:

1. Choosing the probability distribution-related function

2. Choosing parameters of probability distribution-related function?

A common technique that solves this issue is Maximum Likelihood Estimation, or

something you call “maximum likelihood”.

A latent variable model comprises observable variables and unobservable variables.

Observed variables are those that can be measured whereas unobserved

(latent/hidden) variables are inferred from observed variables. 

As explained by the trio, the EM algorithm can be used to determine the local

maximum likelihood (MLE) parameters or maximum a posteriori (MAP) parameters for

latent variables (unobservable variables that need to be inferred from observable

variables) in a statistical model. It is used to predict these values or determine data

that is missing or incomplete, provided that you know the general form of probability

distribution associated with these latent variables.

To put it simply, the general principle behind the EM algorithm in machine learning

involves using observable instances of latent variables to predict values in instances

that are unobservable for learning. This is done until convergence of the values

occurs.

The algorithm is a rather powerful tool in machine learning and is a combination of

many unsupervised algorithms. This includes the k-means clustering algorithm,

among other EM algorithm variants.

Let’s explore the mechanism of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm in Machine

Learning:

Step 1:

Step 1: We have a set of missing or incomplete data and another set of starting

parameters. We assume that observed data or the initial values of the parameters

are generated from a speciﬁc model.

Step 2:

Step 2: Based on the observable value in the observable instances of the available

data, we will predict or estimate the values in the unobservable instances of the

data or the missing data. This is known as the Expectation step (E – step).

Step 3:

Step 3: Using the data generated from the E – step, we will update the parameters

and complete the data set. This is known as the Maximization step (M – step) which

is used to update the hypothesis.

Steps 2 and step 3 are repeated until convergence. Meaning if the values are not

converging, we will repeat the E – step and M – step.

What Is The Maximum Likelihood Estimation?

What Is The Maximum Likelihood Estimation?

In terms of statistics, maximum likelihood estimation is a method that helps to

estimate all parameters of the probability distribution. The same works by maximizing

a likelihood function for making probable the observed data for any statistical model.

However, the Maximum Likelihood mode comes with a big limitation. This is its

assumption that data is complete as well as fully observed. It never mandates that a

model could actually access all data. It goes on to assume that all variables that are

relevant to a model are already present. The reality is that some relevant variables

could remain hidden, leading to inconsistencies. Such hidden variables causing

inconsistencies are termed Latent Variables.

Advantages and Disadvantages of the EM Algorithm

Disadvantages of EM Algorithm

Disadvantages of EM Algorithm

1 Every iteration in the EM algorithm results in a guaranteed increase in likelihood.

2 The Expectation step and Maximization step is rather easy and the solution for the latter mostly exists in closed form.

Advantages of the EM Algorithm

Advantages of the EM Algorithm

1 The expectation-Maximization algorithm takes both forward and backward probabilities into account. This is in

contrast with numerical optimization which takes only the forward probabilities into account.

2 EM algorithm convergence is very slow and is only made to the local optima.

Let us understand the EM algorithm using a Gaussian Mixture Model.

EM Algorithm For Gaussian Mixture Model

EM Algorithm For Gaussian Mixture Model

To estimate the parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model, we will need some

observed variables generated by two separate processes whose probability

distributions are known. However, the data points of the two processes are combined

and we do not know which distribution they belong to. 

We aim to estimate the parameters of these distributions using the Maximum

Likelihood estimation of the EM algorithm as explained above. 

Here is the code we will use: 

# Given a function for which we have to compute density of 

# Gaussian at point x_i given mu, sigma: G(x_i, mu, sigma); and

# another function to compute the log-likelihoods: L(x, mu, sigma, pi)

def estimate_gmm(x, K, tol=0.001, max_iter=100):

    ”’ Estimate GMM parameters.

        :param x: list of observed real-valued variables

        :param K: integer for number of Gaussian

        :param tol: tolerated change for log-likelihood

        :return: mu, sigma, pi parameters

    ”’

    # 0. Initialize theta = (mu, sigma, pi)

    N = len(x)

    mu, sigma = [rand()] * K, [rand()] * K


    mu, sigma = [rand()] * K, [rand()] * K

    pi = [rand()] * K

    curr_L = np.inf

    for j in range(max_iter):

        prev_L = curr_L

        # 1. E-step: responsibility = p(z_i = k | x_i, theta^(t-1))

        r = {}

        for i in range(N):

            parts = [pi[k] * G(x_i, mu[k], sigma[k]) for i in range(K)]

            total = sum(parts)

            for i in k:

                r[(i, k)] = parts[k] / total

        # 2. M-step: Update mu, sigma, pi values

        rk = [sum([r[(i, k)] for i in range(N)]) for k in range(K)]

        for k in range(K):

            pi[k] = rk[k] / N

            mu[k] = sum(r[(i, k)] * x[i] for i in range(N)) / rk[k]

            sigma[k] = sum(r[(i, k)] * (x[i] – mu[k]) ** 2) / rk[k]

        # 3. Check exit condition

        curr_L = L(x, mu, sigma, pi)

        if abs(prev_L – curr_L) &lt; tol:


            break

    return mu, sigma, pi

In the E-Step, we can use the Bayes theorem to determine the expected values of the

given data points that are drawn from the past iterations of the algorithm. In the M-

Step, we assume that the values of the latent variables are ﬁxed to estimate the

proxies in the unobserved instances using the Maximum Likelihood. Finally, we use

the standard mean and standard deviation formulas to estimate the parameters of

the gaussian mixture model.

What is meant by EM clustering?

What is meant by EM clustering?

In order to optimize the probability of the observed data, EM clustering is used to estimate the

means and standard deviations for each cluster (distribution). Based on combinations of distinct

distributions in different clusters, the EM algorithm attempts to approximate the observed

distributions of values. EM uses the ﬁnite Gaussian mixture model to cluster data and iteratively

estimates a set of parameters until a desired convergence value is reached. EM clustering yields

ﬁndings that differ from those obtained by K-means clustering.

What are the real-life applications of the EM algorithm?

In the realm of medicine, the EM algorithm is used for image reconstruction. It is also used to

forecast the parameters of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and other mixed models. It also aids in

the completion of missing data in a particular sample. Item parameters and latent abilities in item

response theory models are estimated using EM in psychometrics. It is also widely used in the

ﬁeld of structural engineering.

How is the MLE algorithm different from the EM algorithm?

How is the MLE algorithm different from the EM algorithm?

In the presence of hidden variables, the maximum likelihood estimation process simply challenges

the data. MLE initially collects all of the data and then utilizes it to build the most likely model.

With latent variables, the expectation maximization algorithm provides an iterative solution to

maximum likelihood estimation. EM ﬁrst makes an educated estimate of the parameters, then

checks for missing data, and then changes the model to suit the educated guesses and observed

data.

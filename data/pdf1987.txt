Abstract

This article considers the utility of the bounded cumulative hazard model in cure rate estimation, which is an

appealing alternative to the widely used two-component mixture model. This approach has the following distinct

advantages: (1) It allows for a natural way to extend the proportional hazards regression model, leading to a wide

class of extended hazard regression models. (2) In some settings the model can be interpreted in terms of

biologically meaningful parameters. (3) The model structure is particularly suitable for semiparametric and Bayesian

methods of statistical inference. Notwithstanding the fact that the model has been around for less than a decade, a

large body of theoretical results and applications has been reported to date. This review article is intended to give a

big picture of these modeling techniques and associated statistical problems. These issues are discussed in the

context of survival data in cancer.

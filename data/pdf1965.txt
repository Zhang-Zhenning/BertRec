Query-Likelihood-Retrieval-Model

In the query likelihood retrieval model, we rank documents by the probability that the query text could be generated by the

document language model.

We calculate the probability that we could pull the query words out of the “bucket” of words representing the document.

This is a model of topical relevance,in the sense that the probability of query generation is the measure of how likely it is that a

document is about the same topic as the query.

Jelinek-Mercer Smoothing

Smoothing refers to the process of adjusting the maximum likelihood estimator to account for inaccuracy due to data sparseness.

Jelinek-Mercer Smoothing is a linear interpolation of the document and collection word probabilities, where the coefficient λ

determines the weighing balance between the two terms

Linearly interpolated between document language model and the collection language model 



For lambda, we choose different optimal values for different queries. Experiments have shown that a small value of lambda, around

0.1, works well for long queries and a higher value around 0.7 for short queries.

Data Acquisition

The CACM collection dataset has been acquired from http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test_collections/cacm/

The CACM collection is a collection of titles and abstracts from the journal CACM.

The collection consists of the following files:

cacm.all - Text of documents

cite.info - Key to citation info

common_words - Stop words used by smart

qrels.text - List of relevance judgements

query.text - Original text of the query

CACM HTML documents are obtained from:

https://github.com/kaanosm/inb344/tree/845ae8c8c6e5e193e4f8e9c399ddc9f3c82e39f0/week%201/Resources

64 queries , 3204 HTML documents

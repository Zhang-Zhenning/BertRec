Abstract

The language modeling approach (in its narrow definition) was first introduced by Ponte and Croft in their SIGIR 98 paper [74]. In this work, they

proposed a new way to score a document, later often called the query likelihood scoring method. Since then, the query likelihood retrieval model

has become the basic language modeling approach. In this chapter, we introduce the simple query likelihood retrieval model, which represents the

very first generation of language models applied to information retrieval. These models are as effective as the traditional retrieval models and also

have similar computational complexity, making them excellent alternatives to the traditional TF-IDF weighting retrieval functions. Extensions of the

simple query likelihood retrieval models have led to more effective, but computationally more complex query likelihood retrieval models; they will

be discussed in the next chapter.

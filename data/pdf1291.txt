Useful to all big data applications

Especially useful for mining knowledge about people’s behavior, attitude, and opinions

Directly express knowledge about our world: Small text data are also useful!

66  However, NLP is difficult!

“A man saw a boy with a telescope.” (who had the telescope?)

“He has quit smoking” � he smoked before.

How can we leverage imperfect NLP to

build a perfect general application?

Answer: Having humans in the loop!

1212  A Probabilistic Model for ADR Extraction [Wang et al. 14]

Challenge: how do we separate treated symptoms from side-effect symptoms?

Solution: leverage knowledge about known symptoms of diseases treated by a drug

Probabilistic model

Assume forum posts are generated from a mixture language model

Most words are generated using a background language model

Treated (disease) symptoms and side-eﬀect symptoms are generated from separate models, enabled by the use of external

knowledge about known disease symptoms

Fitting the model to the forum data allows us to learn the side-effect symptom distributions

Observed Patient Record

We show the probability of patient t having symptom s and being prescribed herb h with disease diagnoses Dt.

Here Pr(s,h|t) is the probability of of patient t having symptom s and being prescribed herb h.

Dt is the set of diseases this patient have, which is also observed in the record.

Pr(d|t) is the likelihood of patient t having disease d.

Pr(s|d) is the typical symptoms of disease d.

Pr(h|d) is the typical herbs of disease d.

The goal of optimization is to ﬁnd optimial Pr(s|d), Pr(h|d) and Pr(d|t) so that the probability of all the observed {Pr(s,h|t)}

would be maximzied.

We use EM algorithm to optimize this loss function. The optimization is fast and can be scaled to thousands of medical

record.

More details about the models are in the paper.

S . Wang, E. Huang, R. Zhang, X. Zhang, B. Liu. X. Zhou, C. Zhai, A Conditional Probabilistic Model for Joint Analysis of

Symptoms, Diseases, and Herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine Patient Records, IEEE BIBM 2016.



1616  Evaluation: Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) EMRs

10,907 patients TCM records in digestive system treatment

3,000 symptoms, 97 diseases and 652 herbs

Most frequently occurring disease: chronic gastritis

Most frequently occurring symptoms: abdominal pain and chills

Ground truth: 27,285 manually curated herb-symptom relationship.

While we envision that our method would be used to mine a large number of patient records from multiple physicians, direct

experimentation with such a mixed dataset would make it diﬃcult to choose the most suitable physician to assess the data

mining results. This is because different

physicians tend to have varying opinions due to the differences in their training and experiences.

Thus, we decided to evaluate the proposed model using patient records from a single physician. This way, the physician can

judge to what extent

the mined results match the his reasoning and experience.

Speciﬁcally, we used 10,907 anonymous electronic medical records provided by a TCM physician whose specialization is in

digestive system treatments. We normalized the symptom and herb terms to obtain 9,530 records with 3,000 symptoms, 97

diseases, and 652 herbs.

The most frequently occurring disease is “chronic gastritis” and the most frequently occurring symptom is “abdominal pain

and chills.”

To quantitatively evaluate our model, we collected a set of herb-symptom relationship annotations, manually curated by TCM

experts. These nnotations contain 27,285 herb-symptom relationships. The symptoms and herbs of 1,624 of these

relationships appear in our dataset. Consequently, we evaluate how our method can accurately identify this subset of 1,624

relationships.



1717  Output of the model

As we have introduced before, our model will generate a disease distribution for each record, a symptom proﬁle for each




disease and a herb profile for each disease. Here is an example of the output.

Here, a patient with three disease Anemia, Gastritis and Hypertension will get a distribution. Gastritis will have a probability

of 0.6. It means that most of the symptoms of this patient is caused by Gastritis.

Then we also get a herb and symptom distribution for all these diseases.

For example, anemia will have 0.3 probability of dizziness, 0.3 probability of vomiting and 0.3 probability of hypodynamia.

These probability shows the common symptoms of anemia.

On the other side, anemia will have 0.4 probability of Medlar and 0.3 probability of Ginseng.



1818  “Typical Symptoms” of 3 Diseases: p(s|d)

We show three sample conditional symptom distributions with the highest entropy values among all 100 disease proﬁles

learned with our model. The entropy of a distribution measures its information content. Thus, the higher the entropy, the

more informative the distribution.

Here we show the top ﬁve symptoms, sorted by decreasing probability, for three diﬀerent diseases. The physician judged

these symptoms to be typical symptoms for the corresponding disease. Indeed, the relevance of these symptoms to the

disease is often obvious. For example, “difficult

bowel movements,” “abdominal distension,” and “dry, hard stools” are common symptoms for “constipation.” The fact that

our model was able to learn these associations automatically from the dataset clearly demonstrates the eﬀectiveness of the

model for mining medical knowledge. Our model can also diﬀerentiate between similar diseases, such as “reﬂux esophagitis”

and “chronic gastritis,” which share symptoms such as “acid reﬂux” and “heartburn.” We discover “paresthesia pharynges”

and “discomfort in upper respiratory tract” for “reﬂux esophagitis,” while these symptoms do not appear for “chronic

gastritis.”

Remarkably, many of these symptoms are unique TCM symptoms and are not well-studied in western medicine. For example,

the model discovered that “dark, purplish tongue” is associated with “coronary heart disease.” Our physician veriﬁed these

unique TCM symptoms for their corresponding diseases. This result further shows the eﬀectiveness of using our model in

revealing TCM knowledge from medical records. Our model can provide useful TCM symptoms to facilitate diﬀerential

diagnosis and precision herb prescription.



1919  “Typical Herbs” Prescribed for 3 Diseases: p(h|d)

We show the top ﬁve herbs of selected herb distributions for three diﬀerent diseases. These herbs are unique to TCM and

are unused by western medicine. There is evidence showing the empirical eﬀectiveness of these herbs, of which a deeper

understanding can improve our overall medicinal knowledge. We can see that our model successfully discovered many herbs

with known relations to these different diseases

. For example, our model asserts that “lotus leaves” and “fresh hawthorn” can be used to treat “hyperlipidemia,” which can be

verified by existing TCM knowledge and recent studies.

In addition to supporting existing knowledge, our model can also ﬁnd novel herb prescription knowledge. For instance, our

model determines that “turmeric root” can be used to treat “hypertension.” A recent work showed that curcumin, an active

ingredient of turmeric root, can be used to treat idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, a type of genetic hypertension.

With further analysis on multiple visits of a given patient, we can assess the eﬀectiveness of speciﬁc herbs prescribed for a

disease. This is an important future direction we wish to pursue.

If we consider external factor, there are additional challenges.

For example, this is Dow Jones Industrial Average, average stock price.

Near September, stock price crash. Actually, this is 2001, and September 11 terrorist attack happened at that time.

Like this, these days, need for analyzing text data jointly with external temporal factor is increasing.

If we can understand why this happen, automatically find reasons, it would be very useful.

What are the common analysis operators shared by multiple text analysis tasks?

How can we design a general text analysis language covering many applications?

Retrieval and analysis need to be integrated � A unified operator-based framework

How can we formalize retrieval and analysis functions as multiple compatible general operators?

How can we manage workflow?

How can we optimize human-computer collaboration?

How can TextScope adapt to a user’s need dynamically and support personalization?

Especially useful for mining human behavior, preferences, and opinions

Directly express knowledge (small text data are useful as well)

humans and computers

Let computers do what they are good at (statistical analysis and learning)

Turn imperfect techniques into perfect applications

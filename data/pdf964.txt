Recent progress in deep learning has brought tremendous improvements in conversational AI, leading to a plethora of

commercial conversational services that allow naturally spoken interactions, increasing the need for more human-centric

interactions in IR. As a result, we have witnessed a resurgent interest in developing modern CIR systems in research

communities and industry. This tutorial presents recent advances in CIR, focusing mainly on neural approaches and new

applications developed in the past five years. Our goal is to provide a thorough and in-depth overview of the general

definition of CIR, the components of CIR systems, new applications raised for its conversational aspects, and the (neural)

techniques recently developed for it.

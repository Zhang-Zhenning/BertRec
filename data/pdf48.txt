Outline

• Review Latent Semantic Indexing/Analysis (LSI/LSA)

– LSA is a technique of analyzing relationships between a set 

of documents and the terms they contain by producing a 

set of concepts related to the documents and terms. 

– In the context of its application to information retrieval, it 

is called LSI. 

• Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing/Analysis 

(PLSI/PLSA)

• Hypertext‐Induced Topic Selection (HITS and PHITS)

• Joint model of PHITS and PLSI

CS3750


Review: Latent Semantic 

Analysis/Indexing

• Perform a low‐rank approximation of document‐term 

matrix

• General idea

– Assumes that there is some underlying or latent

structure in word usage that is obscured by variability in 

word choice

– Instead of representing documents and queries as 

vectors in a t‐dimensional space of terms, represent 

them (and terms themselves) as vectors in a lower‐

dimensional space whose axes are concepts that 

effectively group together similar words

– These axes are the Principal Components from PCA 

– Compute document similarity based on the inner product 

in the latent semantic space (cosine metric)

Review: LSA Summary

•

Pros:

– Low‐dimensional document representation is able to capture 

synonyms. Synonyms will fall into same/similar concepts.

– Noise removal and robustness by dimension reduction.

– Exploitation of redundant data

– Correlation analysis and Query expansion (with related words)

– Empirical study shows it outperforms naïve vector space model

– Language independent

– high recall: query and document terms may be disjoint

– Unsupervised/completely automatic

CS3750


Review: LSA Summary

•

Cons:

– No probabilistic model of term occurrences.

– Problem of polysemy (multiple meanings for the same word) is 

not addressed.

– Implicit Gaussian assumption, but term occurrence is not 

normally distributed.

– Euclidean distance is inappropriate as a distance metric for 

count vectors (reconstruction may contain negative entries).

– Directions are hard to interpret.

– Computational complexity is high: O(min(mn2,nm2)) for SVD, 

and it needs to be updated as new documents are 

found/updated

– ad hoc selection of the number of dimensions, model selection

Probabilistic LSA: a statistical view of 

LSA

• Aspect Model

– For co‐occurrence data which associated with a latent class 

variable.

– d and w are independent conditioned on z, where d is 

document, w is term, z is concept

Why Latent Concept?

• Sparseness problem, terms not occurring in a 

document get zero probability

• “Unmixing” of superimposed concepts

• No prior knowledge about concepts required

• Probabilistic dimension reduction

CS3750


Quick Detour: PPCA vs. PLSA

• PPCA is also a probabilistic model.

• PPCA assume normal distribution, which is 

often not valid.

• PLSA models the probability of each co‐

occurrence as a mixture of conditionally 

independent multinomial distributions.

• Multinomial distribution is a better alternative 

in this domain.

CS3750

PLSA Mixture Decomposition Vs. 

LSA/SVD

• PLSA is based on mixture decomposition derived 

from latent class model.

• Different from LSA/SVD: non‐negative and 

normalized

KL Projection

• What does it mean?

– When we maximize the log‐likelihood of the 

model, we are minimizing the KL divergence 

between the empirical distribution and the model 

P(w|d) .

PLSA via EM

• E-step: estimate posterior probabilities of latent 

variables, (“concepts”)

• M‐step: parameter estimation based on  expected statistics.

Tempered EM

• The aspect model tend to over‐fit easily.  

– Think about the number of free parameters we 

need to learn.

– Entropic regularization based Tempered EM

– E‐Step is modified as follows:

– Part of training data are held‐out for internal 

validation. Best β is chosen based on this 

validation process.

Fold‐in Queries/New Documents

• Concepts are not changed from the original 

training data. 

• Only p(z|d) is changed, p(w|z) are the same in 

M‐step.

• However, when we fix the concepts for new 

documents we are not getting the generative 

model any more.

CS3750

PLSA Summary

• Optimal decomposition relies on  likelihood function of 

multinomial sampling, which corresponds to a minimization 

of KL divergence between the empirical distribution and the 

model.

• Problem of polysemy is better addressed.

• Directions in the PLSA are multinomial word distributions.

• EM approach gives local solution.

• Possible to do the model selection and complexity control.

• Number of parameters increases linearly with number of 

documents. 

• Not a generative model for new documents.

CS3750


Link Analysis Techniques

• Motivations

– The number of pages that could reasonably be 

returned as relevant is far too large for a human

– identify those relevant pages that are the most 

authoritative

– Page content is insufficient to define 

authoritativeness

– Exploit hyperlink structure to assess and quantify 

authoritativeness

CS3750

Hypertext Induced Topic Search (HITS)

• Associate two numerical scores with each 

document in a hyperlinked collection: authority 

score and hub score

– Authorities: most definitive information sources (on a 

specific topic)

– Hubs: most useful compilation of links to 

authoritative documents

• A good hub is a page that points to many good 

authorities; a good authority is a page that is 

pointed to by many good hubs

update equations

HITS Summary

• Compute query dependent authority and hub 

scores.

• Computational tractable (due to base set 

subgraph).

• Sensitive to Web spam (artificially increasing hub 

and authority weight, consider a highly 

interconnected set of sites).

• Dominant topic in base set may not be the 

intended one.

• Converge to the largest principle component of 

the adjacency matrix.

CS3750

PHITS

•

Probabilistic version of HITS.

•

We try to find out the web communities 

from the Co‐citation matrix.

•

Loading on eigenvector in the case of HITS 

does not necessarily reflect the authority of 

document in community.

•

HITS uses only the largest eigenvector and 

this is not necessary the principal 

community. 

•

What about smaller communities? (smaller 

eigenvectors) They can be still very 

important.

•

Mathematically equivalent as PLSA

• Add latent “communities” between documents and citations

• Describe citation likelihood as:

P(d,c) = P(d)P(c|d),    where

P(c|d) = Σ P(c|z)P(z|d)

• Total likelihood of citations matrix M:

L(M) = Π

maximization problem.

Interpreting the PHITS Results

• Simple analog to authority score is P(c|z).

– How likely a document c is to be cited from within the 

community z.

• P(d|z) serves the same function as hub score.

– The probability that document d contains a citation to 

a given community z.

• Document classification using P(z|c).

– Classify the documents according its community 

membership.

• Find characteristic document of a community 

with P(z|c) * P(c|z). 

CS3750

PHITS Issues

• Local optimal solution from EM.

– Possible to use PCA solution as the seed.

• Manually set the number of communities.

– Split the factor and use model selection criterion 

like AIC and BIC to justify the split.

– Iteratively extract factors and stop when the 

magnitude of them is over the threshhold.

CS3750


Problems with Link‐only Approach 

(e.g. PHITS)

• Not all links are created by human.

• The top ranked authority pages may be 

irrelevant to the query if they are just well 

connected.

• Web Spam.

CS3750

PLSA and PHITS

• Joint probabilistic model of document content 

(PLSA) and connectivity (PHITS).

• Able to answer questions on both structure 

and content.

• Likelihood is 

• EM approach to estimate the probabilities.

CS3750




Reference Flow

• Two factor spaces

• Documents 

• Reference Flow between

• This can be useful to create a better web crawler.

– First locate the factor space of a new document using 

its content.

– Use reference flow to compute the probability that 

this document could contain links to the factor space 

we are interested in.

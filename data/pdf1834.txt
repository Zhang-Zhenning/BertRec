Abstract

The language modeling approach to information retrieval has recently attracted much attention. In the language modeling retrieval models, we can

score and rank documents based on the query likelihood method. From the theoretical perspective, however, the justification of the existing

(standard) query likelihood method based on the probability ranking principle requires an unrealistic assumption about the generation of a “negative

query” from a document, which states that the probability that a user who dislikes a document would use a query does not depend on the

particular document. This assumption enables ignoring the negative query generation so as to justify using the basic query likelihood method as a

retrieval function. In reality, however, this assumption does not hold because a user who dislikes a document would more likely avoid using words

in the document when posing a query. This suggests that the standard query likelihood function is a potentially non-optimal retrieval function. In this

paper, we attempt to improve the standard language modeling retrieval models by bringing back the component of negative query generation.

Specifically, we propose a general and efficient approach to estimate document-dependent probabilities of negative query generation based on the

principle of maximum entropy, and derive a more complete query likelihood retrieval function that also contains the negative query generation

component. In addition, we further develop a more general probabilistic distance retrieval method to naturally incorporate query language models,

which covers the proposed query likelihood with negative query generation as its special case. The proposed approaches not only bridge the

theoretic gap between the standard language modeling retrieval models and the notion of relevance, but also improves the retrieval effectiveness

with (almost) no additional computational cost.

Notes

1. It has been pointed out by Robertson (2005) that this document generation approach by Lafferty and Zhai (2003) is not theoretically

equivalent to the classical probabilistic retrieval model (Robertson and Sparck-Jones 1976) due to their different event spaces. This issue,

however, is out the scope of this work which focuses on the query generation approach, i.e., the language modeling retrieval model (Ponte

and Croft 1998).


2. Although Robertson (2005) pointed out that Lafferty and Zhai (2003)’s conclusion may not be a valid general inference from the original

probability ranking principle (Robertson 1977) due to their inconsistent event spaces, and Aly et al. (2014) further argued that the

connection between the standard probability ranking principle and the language modeling approach may not be established on the level of

probabilistic models, Lafferty and Zhai (2003)’s work, however, still presented a formal and widely-accepted way to connect the language

modeling approach to the notion of “relevance” that could answer the question: “where is relevance?”.

3. Note that D is not a binary random variable. D and \(\bar{D}\) are two separate variables both of which can take as value any single

document, but the value of \(\bar{D}\) depends on D.

5. Following previous work (Zhai and Lafferty 2001a), we use the same query language model to compare XLM and LM so that we can

focus on the comparison of scoring functions, i.e., XLM and LM, rather than the feedback techniques. Specifically, the feedback

interpolation coefficient \(\alpha = 0.8\), the number of feedback documents to 20, the number of terms in feedback model to 50, and the

two parameters \(\sigma\) and \(\lambda\) inside the positional relevance model are set to their default values as suggested by Lv and Zhai

(2010).

Generative VS Discriminative Models

Story:

is this animal a lion or an elephant

closest match 

different properties learned

decision boundary between the classes

actual distribution of each class

joint probability distribution p(x,y).

Bayes Theorem

conditional probability

distribution p(y|x)

supervised learning




In Math,

Generative classifiers

P(Y), P(X|Y)

P(X|Y), P(Y)

P(Y |X)

Discriminative Classifiers

P(Y|X)

P(Y|X)

Examples:

Generative classifiers

Discriminative Classifiers

Questions:

What happens when we give correlated features in discriminative models?

What happens when we give correlated features in generative models?

Which models works very well even on less training data?

Is it possible to generate data from with the help of these models?


Which model will take less time to get trained?

Which model will take less time to predict output?

Which model fails to work well if we give a lot of features?

Which model prone to overfitting very easily?

Which model prone to underfitting easily?

What happens when training data is biased over one class in Generative Model?

What happens when training data is biased over one class in Discriminative Models?

Which model is more sensitive to outliers?

Can you able to fill out the missing values in a dataset with the help of these models?

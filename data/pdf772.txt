The Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm

Understanding the motivations and how the EM Algorithm works

By probabilistic generative model, think of it as a model that instead of

doing “hard” assignment providing a cluster for each data point (e.g., K-

Means). The model will provide the probability that a given data point

belongs to each cluster. This is called “soft” assignment.

Note that the update of μ, Σ, and π, all depend on the responsibilities (rᵢⱼ), which by its

turn, depends on μ, Σ, and π.

What are N-Grams?

By Kavita Ganesan / AI Implementation, Text Mining Concepts

N-grams of texts are extensively used in text mining and natural language processing tasks. They

are basically a set of co-occurring words within a given window and when computing the n-grams

you typically move one word forward (although you can move X words forward in more advanced

scenarios).

For example, for the sentence “The cow jumps over the moon”. If N=2 (known as bigrams), then

the ngrams would be:

the cow

cow jumps

jumps over

over the

the moon

So you have 5 n-grams in this case. Notice that we moved from the-&gt;cow to cow-&gt;jumps to jumps-

&gt;over, etc, essentially moving one word forward to generate the next bigram.

If N=3, the n-grams would be:

the cow jumps

cow jumps over

jumps over the

over the moon

So you have 4 n-grams in this case. When N=1, this is referred to as unigrams and this is






essentially the individual words in a sentence. When N=2, this is called bigrams and when N=3 this

is called trigrams. When N&gt;3 this is usually referred to as four grams or five grams and so on.

How many N-grams in a sentence?

If X=Num of words in a given sentence K, the number of n-grams for sentence K would be:



What are N-grams used for?

N-grams are used for a variety of different task. For example, when developing a language model, n-

grams are used to develop not just unigram models but also bigram and trigram models. Google

and Microsoft have developed web scale n-gram models that can be used in a variety of tasks such

as spelling correction, word breaking and text summarization. Here is a publicly available web scale

n-gram model by Microsoft: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/focus/cs/web-

ngram.aspx. Here is a paper that uses Web N-gram models for text summarization:Micropinion

Generation: An Unsupervised Approach to Generating Ultra-Concise Summaries of

Opinions

Another use of n-grams is for developing features for supervised Machine Learning models such as

SVMs, MaxEnt models, Naive Bayes, etc. The idea is to use tokens such as bigrams in the feature

space instead of just unigrams. But please be warned that from my personal experience and various

research papers that I have reviewed, the use of bigrams and trigrams in your feature space may not

necessarily yield any significant improvement. The only way to know this is to try it!

Java for N-gram Generation

This code block generates n-grams at a sentence level. The input consists of N (the size of n-gram),

sent the sentence and ngramList a place to store the n-grams generated.


 

private static void generateNgrams(int N, String sent, List ngramList)

 {

  String[] tokens = sent.split("\\s+"); //split sentence into tokens

 

  //GENERATE THE N-GRAMS

  for(int k=0; k&lt;(tokens.length-N+1); k++){

    String s="";

    int start=k;

    int end=k+N;

    for(int j=start; j&lt;end; j++){

     s=s+""+tokens[j];

    }

    //Add n-gram to a list

    ngramList.add(s);

  }

}//End of method

Python code for N-gram Generation

Similar to the example above, the code below generates n-grams in python.


import re

def generate_ngrams(text,n):

    # split sentences into tokens

    tokens=re.split("\\s+",text)

    ngrams=[]

    # collect the n-grams

    for i in range(len(tokens)-n+1):

       temp=[tokens[j] for j in range(i,i+n)]

       ngrams.append(" ".join(temp))

    return ngrams

If you’re using Python, here’s another way to do it using NLTK:

from nltk import ngrams

sentence = '_start_ this is ngram _generation_'

my_ngrams = ngrams(sentence.split(), 3)

There is a typo. The code block after “for i” should be indented.

for i in range(len(tokens)-n+1):

temp=[tokens[j] for j in range(i,i+n)]

For the sake of completeness of the article, it is also better to mention the nltk ngrams class.

from nltk import ngrams

sentence = ‘start this is ngram genertion end’

my_grams = ngrams(sentence.split(), 3)

for grams in my_grams:

print (grams)

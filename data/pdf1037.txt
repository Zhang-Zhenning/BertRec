Empirical distribution

Empirical distribution

by Marco Taboga, PhD

The empirical distribution, or empirical distribution function, can be used to describe a sample of

observations of a given variable. Its value at a given point is equal to the proportion of observations

from the sample that are less than or equal to that point.



Definition

Definition

The following is a formal definition.

Definition  Let



be a sample of size 



, where 



,...,



 are the 



 observations from the sample. The empirical

distribution function of the sample 



 is the function 



 defined as



where 



 is an indicator function that is equal to 



 if 



 and 



 otherwise.

In other words, the value of the empirical distribution function at a given point 



 is obtained by:

1. counting the number of observations that are less than or equal to 



;

2. dividing the number thus obtained by the total number of observations, so as to obtain the

proportion of observations that is less than or equal to 



.

An example follows.

Example  Suppose we observe a sample made of four observations:



where




What is the value of the empirical distribution function of the sample 



 at the point 



?

According to the definition above, it is



In other words, the proportion of observations that are less than or equal to 



 is 



.

The empirical distribution is the distribution function of a

Let 



,...,



 be the sample observations ordered from the smallest to the largest (in technical

terms, the order statistics of the sample).

Then it is easy to see that the empirical distribution function can be written as



This is a function that is everywhere flat except at sample points, where it jumps by 



. It is the

distribution function of a discrete random variable 



 that can take any one of the values 



,...,



with probability 



. In other words, it is the distribution function of a discrete variable

When the 



 observations from the sample 



,...,



 are the realizations of 



 random variables 



,...,




, then the value 



 taken by the empirical distribution at a given point 



 can also be regarded as

a random variable. Under the hypothesis that all the random variables 



,...,



 have the same

distribution, the expected value and the variance of 



 can be easily computed, as shown in the

following proposition.

Proposition  If the 



 observations in the sample



are the realizations of 



 random variables 



,...,



 having the same distribution function 



, then



for any 



. Furthermore, if 



,...,



 are mutually independent, then



for any 



.

Proof

Thus, for any given point, the empirical distribution function is an unbiased estimator of the true

distribution function. Furthermore, its variance tends to zero as the sample size becomes large (as 



tends to infinity).

Large sample properties

Large sample properties

An immediate consequence of the previous result is that the empirical distribution converges in

mean-square to the true one.

Proposition  If the 



 observations in the sample



are the realizations of 



 mutually independent random variables 



,...,



 having the same

distribution function 



, then



for any 



.

Proof

As a matter of fact, it is possible to prove a much stronger result, called Glivenko-Cantelli theorem,

which states that not only 



 converges almost surely to 



 for each 



, but it also converges

uniformly, that is,



Furthermore, the assumption that the random variables 



,...,



 be mutually independent can be

relaxed (see, e.g., Borokov 1999) to allow for some dependence among the observations (similarly to

This is a PLSA (Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis) implementation via the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm.

Current issues:

1. The code are not well tested, so it may contain bugs. The test text are in the folder ./texts and ./test.

2. The code seems not working well with small datasets, such as ./test

Note:

A Tutorial on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis by Liangjie Hong is not a very good PLSA introduction material. There are some

known bugs.
